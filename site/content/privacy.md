# Privacy Policy

**Q: I am concerned about my privacy.**

No worries. The site itself has no tracking features, so no personal information is collected or stored.

If you decided to signup for the email newsletter, I do need your email address. 
Email addresses are stored in a mailing list in Mailgun, a leading email delivery service.
I use your email to send you the email newsletter, which may contain more information on Your Amicus 
from time to time. Other than that, I will not use your email address for any other purpose.

To unsubscribe from the mailing list, please visit this [page](/unsubscribe).
