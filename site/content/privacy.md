# Privacy Policy

**Q: I am concerned about my privacy.**

No worries. The site itself has no tracking features, so no personal information is collected or stored.

If you decided to signup for the email newsletter, I do need your email address. 
Email addresses are stored in a mailing list in Mailgun, a leading email delivery service.
I use your email to send you an email newsletter, which may contain more information on Your Amicus 
from time to time. Other than that, I will not use your email address for any other purpose.

To unsubscribe from the mailing list, you should follow the link in the email. There is no other (automated) way
to unsubscribe, so please [email me](mailto:cookies@your-amicus.app) to do so 
if you do not or can't use the link in the email.
