  "In the court's stern gaze, truth's harsh light unfurls,  
  Silent screams echo, as justice twirls.  
  In the web of deceit, a plot thickens and curls,  
  Money's tainted touch, in innocence's world.  
  Yet, in the heart of darkness, hope's flag unfurls,  
  In the dance of law, the tale of life whirls."

"In the court's stern gaze, truth's harsh light unfurls,  
Silent screams echo, as justice twirls.  
In the web of deceit, a plot thickens and curls,  
Money's tainted touch, in innocence's world.  
Yet, in the heart of darkness, hope's flag unfurls,  
In the dance of law, the tale of life whirls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


This article discusses the sentencing of a stepfather and mother in Singapore for the death of an 11-year-old girl. The stepfather, Mohamad Fazli Selamat, was sentenced to 15 years and 11 months' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for repeatedly hitting the girl with an exercise bar, causing fatal head injuries. The girl's mother, Roslinda Jamil, was sentenced to seven years, eight months, and three weeks in jail for failing to intervene and for covering up past incidents of abuse. Roslinda is the first person to be convicted under a law introduced in 2020 that targets those who fail to protect victims from abuse. The couple pleaded guilty to their offenses in February 2023. The article also mentions that a gag order on the couple's names was lifted after the sentencing. The victim's three younger half-siblings, who were potential witnesses, are no longer a concern. The article provides details of the abuse inflicted on the girl, including hitting her with a belt, backscratcher, and exercise bar. The abuse was known to family members, who scolded Fazli and Roslinda but failed to stop the abuse. The article concludes by stating that the couple's other children are in the care of different family members or foster care. 

In summary, a stepfather has been sentenced to jail and caning, while the girl's mother has been sentenced to jail for their roles in the death of an 11-year-old girl. This case highlights the legal consequences for failing to protect victims from abuse and covers up past incidents.

A man in Singapore has admitted to aiding money laundering in connection with phishing scams targeting OCBC Bank customers. Jovan Soh Jun Yan and his accomplices sourced and provided control of bank accounts to unknown individuals linked to overseas syndicates.

This article discusses the legal obligations and consequences for not reporting abuse and other crimes in Singapore. While there is no general obligation to report offenses, the law requires the public to report serious crimes such as abuse. Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code lists around 50 offenses that must be reported to the police unless there is a "reasonable excuse" not to do so. Failure to report an offense can result in imprisonment or a fine under Section 202 of the Penal Code. However, there are no specific laws that make it compulsory for family members to report crimes committed against their loved ones or minors. The article also explores the reasons why some people may be reluctant to report abuse, including fear of retaliation, financial dependence, denial or lack of awareness, and shame or stigma. It emphasizes the importance of encouraging victims and witnesses to report abuse cases to break the cycle of violence.
