  "In the dance of law, where minds and matters twirl,  
  Through the maze of age, where time unfurls.  
  Guardians of wealth, in trust they twine,  
  In the twilight years, where suns decline.  
  In the court of life, where truths are hurled,  
  Echoes the tale, of our changing world."

"In the dance of law, where minds and matters twirl,  
Through the maze of age, where time unfurls.  
Guardians of wealth, in trust they twine,  
In the twilight years, where suns decline.  
In the court of life, where truths are hurled,  
Echoes the tale, of our changing world."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.

This article discusses the debate around the statutory retirement age in Singapore and whether it is relevant in today's world. While having a retirement age helps workers prepare for life beyond work, it can also perpetuate ageism and restrict the opportunities of older workers who are still highly capable. The Ministry of Manpower plans to gradually raise the retirement age from 63 to 65 and the re-employment age from 68 to 70 by 2030. However, to fully realize the benefits of an extended working life, employers need to redesign work to effectively utilize older workers, and there needs to be a change in social practices and attitudes towards aging in the workforce. The article suggests that a flexible system that values output over age and promotes phased retirement and flexible working arrangements could be a better approach. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Should-one-have-to-bow-out-just-because-of-a-retirement-age-Commentary)\]
