  "In the courts of law, where justice twirls,  
  Through the maze of claims, the truth unfurls.

  Beware the snares, as the tale unfurls.  
  In the realm of health, where hope unfurls,  
  Life's tapestry in the news summary swirls."

"In the courts of law, where justice twirls,  
Through the maze of claims, the truth unfurls.  
In the dance of finance, where deceit whirls,  
Beware the snares, as the tale unfurls.  
In the realm of health, where hope unfurls,  
Life's tapestry in the news summary swirls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The number of claims lodged with the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT) in Singapore for rental disputes has been increasing annually since 2019, with a 62% increase in 2023 compared to pre-pandemic levels. The rise in tenancy disputes is attributed to a greater awareness of legal rights among tenants and landlords and a reliance on housing agents for advice. Common issues in tenancy disputes include security deposits, property damage, early contract termination, and unpaid rent. To resolve these disputes, legal experts emphasize the importance of meticulous documentation and clear tenancy agreements that outline tenant responsibilities. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-landlords-and-tenants-turn-to-Small-Claims-Tribunals-to-settle-rental-disputes)\]

The article discusses the possible expansion of coverage under Singapore's national health insurance scheme, MediShield Life, to include cell, tissue, and gene therapy products (CTGTPs). Healthcare experts have praised this potential inclusion, as these cutting-edge treatments offer hope for previously incurable diseases. The MediShield Life Council is currently reviewing the scheme and is expected to finalize its recommendations by the second half of 2024. The article also highlights the need to consider the cost-effectiveness of CTGTP treatments and the potential impact on premiums for both MediShield Life and Integrated Shield Plans (IPs). \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Healthcare-experts-laud-inclusion-of-state-of-the-art-therapies-in-MediShield-Life-review)\]

In this case, a man failed in his claim for inheritance left by his grandfather. The deceased had made a will in 1992, stating that 20 percent of his estate would be shared by his male-line grandsons born to his sons within 21 years of his death. The claimant, Mr. Julian Lim, argued that he qualified for the inheritance as the sole beneficiary. However, the court dismissed his claim, finding that he did not fulfill the condition that the beneficiary must have been in the custody, care, and control of his father. The judge concluded that the condition applied to adult male-line grandsons who had been in their fathers' custody when they were minors. 

Takeaway: The court's decision emphasizes the importance of meeting the specific conditions outlined in a will for inheritance claims. In this case, the condition required the claimant to have been in the custody, care, and control of his father, which he did not fulfill. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Man-fails-in-claim-for-inheritance-left-by-grandfather-to-only-male-line-grandsons)\]
