## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Leader of the House, Indranee Rajah, will address Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin's comment caught on a hot mic during the next Parliament sitting. Tan apologized for using inappropriate language towards MP Jamus Lim. The incident has sparked public interest, but it is unlikely to result in major consequences. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Indranee-to-address-Speaker-Tan-Chuan-Jins-hot-mic-incident-at-next-Parliament-sitting)\]

Singapore has introduced a framework for platform workers to have formal representation in negotiations with platform operators. This protects workers' interests while maintaining flexibility. Representation can be through direct recognition or a secret ballot. Disputes can be resolved through the Ministry of Manpower and the Industrial Arbitration Court. The framework lays the foundation for stable relationships but may need refinement. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-power-to-gig-workers-a-key-step-towards-a-better-platform-economy)\]

Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin has apologized for using "unparliamentary language" in response to MP Jamus Lim's speech. The rules on such language do not specify consequences for the Speaker. Previous incidents did not result in formal action. Tan is expected to apologize during the next Parliamentary sitting. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Speaker-Tan-Chuan-Jins-use-of-unparliamentary-language-what-are-the-Houses-rules-on-such-conduct-Explainer)\]
