Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From correction orders to domestic workers bold.  
Suspended lawyers and debates on AI,  
A world of law, where truth and justice lie.  
Today's blog post, a vivid tale we'll weave,  
With news summaries, easy to perceive.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore's Ministry of Law has issued correction orders under Pofma to Kenneth Jeyaretnam, Thamil Selvan, and Jom for spreading false information about rentals on Ridout Road. The Ministry clarified that contracts were awarded through open tenders and found no evidence of corruption. Correction notices must be carried with a link to the government's Factually article. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Pofma-orders-issued-to-Kenneth-Jeyaretnam-FB-user-and-online-site-over-Ridout-Road-rentals)\]

Zin Mar Nwe, a domestic worker in Singapore, was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering her employer's mother-in-law. Despite enduring abuse, Zin Mar Nwe tolerated it until the elderly woman threatened to send her back to her home country in debt. This triggered her to stab the woman 26 times. She was arrested and found guilty of murder, receiving a life sentence. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/She-tolerated-abuse-but-threat-of-being-sent-home-triggered-maid-to-stab-boss-mum-in-law)\]

The article debates pausing AI development due to risks. Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework emphasizes a human-centric approach, transparency, and accuracy of data. It suggests addressing liability and encourages a balanced approach. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Instead-of-pausing-AI-development-aim-to-mitigate-risks-Opinion)\]
