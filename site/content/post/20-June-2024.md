"In courts of law where truth and justice twine, <br>  
Deceit and trust in tangled dance align. <br>  
From spiritual deceit to breach of trust, <br>  
In fathers' pleas for love, in fairness thrust. <br>  
In every tale, a lesson to discern, <br>  
In every case, a verdict to be learned."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Woo May Hoe, a self-proclaimed spiritual leader in Singapore, has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in jail for cheating her followers out of over $7 million and subjecting them to physical abuse, including forcing some to eat human faeces. Woo claimed to be a deity and convinced her followers that the money they gave her would go to a society in India. She also ordered her followers to buy properties and cars for her, and punished those who displeased her by physically assaulting them. Despite being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, there was no link found between her mental state and her criminal behavior. 

The case highlights the vulnerability of individuals who fall victim to charismatic leaders and the importance of protecting followers from exploitation. It also emphasizes the need for legal frameworks to address cases involving manipulation and abuse in spiritual or religious contexts. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-than-10-years-jail-for-spiritual-leader-who-cheated-followers-of-over-7m-forced-some-to-eat-faeces)\]

Ivy Tan Yee Ling, a finance and human resources manager, has been sentenced to 66 months' jail after being convicted of four charges of criminal breach of trust by a servant. Tan misappropriated around $631,000 from the firm she worked for by depositing cheques into her personal account and those of her friends and her company. She claimed to have received "secret instructions" from the company's owner, but the prosecutor argued this was not credible. Tan's previous conviction for criminal breach of trust in 2012 was taken into account, and there was a call for strong deterrence in sentencing. 

In conclusion, Ivy Tan Yee Ling has been sentenced to 66 months' jail for misappropriating over $630,000 from her employer. Her claim of receiving "secret instructions" from her employer was rejected by the prosecutor, who argued that her account was not credible.
