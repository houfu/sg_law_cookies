Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In Singapore's legal scene,    
Drama ebbs and flows, oftentimes unseen.    
Investors seek recourse in foreign lands,    
While a son's lies earn him reprimands.    
Discrimination fought with tripartite zeal,    
A reminder that all workers deserve a fair deal.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.

Karl Liew, son of ex-Changi Airport Group chairman, was jailed for two weeks for lying to a judge in the case against the family's maid, Parti Liyani, whom he falsely accused of stealing his belongings. The judge rejected the prosecution's request for a fine, labeling Liew's actions "brazen fraud." Liyani was acquitted of all charges in September 2020 but suffered financially and socially during the lengthy legal process. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Karl-Liew-son-of-ex-Changi-Airport-Group-chairman-gets-2-weeks-jail-for-lying-to-judge-in-Parti-Liyani-case)\]
