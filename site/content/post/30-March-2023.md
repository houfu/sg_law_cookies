## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


PPP Laser Clinic founder Dr Goh Seng Heng was found guilty of transferring assets to his family to defraud creditors. The court declared these transactions void and ordered assets to be vested with the Official Assignee. Businesswoman Wang Xiaopu won a lawsuit against Dr Goh in 2019 for return of investment. Dr Goh's son and daughter were ordered to sell their properties and pay 50% of proceeds to the OA. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Founder-of-clinic-chain-moved-Sentosa-properties-other-assets-out-of-creditors-reach-Judge)\]

Lawyer Charles Yeo Yao Hui had his $15,000 bail forfeited after absconding. He was charged with harassment and wounding religious feelings. Yeo was allowed to leave Singapore in July 2022 but failed to return and posted on Instagram that he intended to seek political asylum in the UK. In November 2022, he was convicted of contempt of court for scandalising the judiciary. The warrant for his arrest is still active. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Fugitive-lawyer-Charles-Yeo-told-investigator-he-does-not-intend-to-return-to-Singapore)\]
