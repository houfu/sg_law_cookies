Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From custody battles to goods bought and sold.  
A doctor's secrets, exposed through recordings' might,  
A hospital seeks justice, reclaiming what's right.  
VietJet faces a lawsuit, planes caught in a bind,  
Legal battles in Singapore, captivating the mind.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A doctor in Singapore has lost overnight access to his two children after his ex-wife submitted audio recordings to court, revealing his sexual promiscuity and "unhealthy obsession" with pornography and sex with underage girls. The transcripts included conversations where the doctor discussed having sex with underage girls with a close friend who offered to take care of the children. The judge agreed with the mother that there was a risk of harm to the children posed by the father's negative influence and his association with individuals encouraging him to engage in illegal activities. The judge rejected the father's argument that his words were jokes or locker room talk, stating that the evidence showed his lustful desire for underage girls. The father has appealed the decision. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Doctor-who-has-obsession-with-sex-with-underage-girls-loses-overnight-access-to-his-2-kids)\]

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) in Singapore is seeking to recover $5.7 million from third-party buyers who allegedly purchased stolen goods, including milk powder, from one of its former employees. The hospital claims that the buyers, Cantley Lifecare and its directors, received the goods over an eight-year period. KTPH alleges that the buyers bribed the former employee to supply them with the hospital's goods. The defendants deny collusion and argue that they believed the goods were obtained from the hospital's suppliers. KTPH has already obtained a default judgment against the former employee for breaching his duties. The police investigation is ongoing. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/KTPH-seeks-to-recover-57m-from-third-party-buyers-of-stolen-goods-including-milk-powder)\]

VietJet Aviation and its founder, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, are being sued in Singapore for allegedly conspiring to block the release of four leased planes worth over US$200 million. FW Aviation (Holdings) 1, the beneficial owner of the planes, accuses Thao of conspiring with VietJet executives and two Singapore companies to thwart a repossession attempt. The case is being closely watched by the aviation industry, as it may have implications for the financing cost of plane deliveries for Vietnamese airlines. A case conference will be held on October 25 in Singapore's High Court. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/VietJets-billionaire-founder-sued-in-Singapore-over-4-leased-planes-worth-over-US200-million)\]
