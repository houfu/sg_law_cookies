In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From crypto assets to empty seats untold.  
High Court rulings grant property rights anew,  
While Parliament's vacancies raise questions, true.  
A lawyer's hearing, a client's breach in sight,  
Today's blog post brings legal tales to light.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore's High Court has ruled that holders of crypto assets have legally enforceable property rights, marking a significant precedent. In the case of ByBit Fintech seeking to recover Tether stablecoins from an employee, the court held that crypto assets are enforceable through court orders and subject to trusts. The employee was ordered to repay the funds and transfer the remaining crypto assets. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/High-Court-rules-crypto-asset-holder-has-legally-enforceable-property-right-in-landmark-decision)\]
