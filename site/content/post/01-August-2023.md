In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From cleared misconduct to leaders bold.  
Adrian Tan, a compassionate guide,  
His wit and wisdom, forever abide.  
Electricity rules tighten their hold,  
While SFOs face anti-money laundering's code.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.

Singapore is implementing stricter rules for electricity retailers to protect consumers from volatile prices. Retailers must have a net worth of $1 million and obtain EMA's approval for key appointments. They can no longer terminate contracts without payment or default by the consumer. Existing retailers must hedge at least 80% of their retail contract position and provide a performance bond. EMA plans to increase electricity capacity. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Stricter-rules-for-electricity-retailers-to-better-protect-consumers)\]

MAS is proposing new requirements for single family offices (SFOs) to comply with anti-money laundering controls. SFOs must be incorporated in Singapore, report annual assets, and maintain a relationship with an MAS-regulated financial institution. This strengthens surveillance against money laundering risks in Singapore's SFO sector. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/MAS-proposes-single-family-offices-seeking-licensing-exemptions-must-incorporate-locally-report-annual-assets)\]
