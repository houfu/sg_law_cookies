Missteps and claims in shadows hide.<br>

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the termination of Singapore Post's CEO and two senior executives following disciplinary proceedings related to serious misconduct involving falsification of delivery data. 

Key legal aspects include the board's adherence to due process, allowing the executives to respond to allegations, and the substantiation of claims through internal and external investigations. The executives contest their terminations, alleging unfairness and lack of substantive grounds. Relevant precedents include the boardâ€™s engagement of external legal counsel to ensure impartiality and the filing of police reports against the executives, indicating potential criminal implications. 

In conclusion, the case underscores the importance of corporate governance and transparency in handling whistleblower reports and disciplinary actions. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SingPost-board-outlines-details-of-proceedings-that-led-it-to-fire-its-CEO-and-two-senior-executives)\]

This article discusses a significant case regarding travel insurance validity in Singapore, emphasizing the importance of accurate information on insurance applications. 

A young traveler faced claim rejection due to incorrectly entering his departure date, which rendered his policy void. The Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre upheld the insurer's decision, highlighting that policies require precise dates covering the entire trip. This case underscores the legal principle that insurers are not obligated to honor claims when applicants fail to provide accurate information, regardless of the circumstances.

In conclusion, travelers must diligently verify their insurance details to avoid costly mistakes, as insurers are bound by the terms set forth in the policy. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Travel-insurance-can-be-void-if-you-put-the-wrong-departure-date)\]

The article discusses a legal dispute between the management corporation of Guilin View condominium and the owners of the top-floor unit regarding access for essential repair and repainting works.

The management corporation has sought a court order to gain entry into the couple's unit, as their refusal has left the facade unrepaired since 2008, potentially violating the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA). A key legal aspect highlighted is the court's ruling that no prior permission was needed to initiate proceedings against the undischarged bankrupt owner, Mr. Tan, as the case does not involve creditor-related issues. The judge suggested mediation as a preferable resolution, emphasizing that litigation serves no beneficial purpose and could lead to criminal implications for the couple if access is indefinitely denied.

In conclusion, the case underscores the importance of compliance with maintenance obligations under the BMSMA and the potential consequences of obstructing necessary repairs. Mediation is recommended as a constructive path forward. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Condo-management-seeks-entry-to-top-floor-unit-after-owners-refuse-roof-access-for-painting-works)\]

The article discusses the bankruptcy declaration of OK Lim, founder of Hin Leong, and his children following a significant financial settlement. 

The Lims were declared bankrupt after agreeing to pay US$3.5 billion to liquidators and HSBC, stemming from claims of fraudulent trading and breach of fiduciary duties. While they consented to the judgment, they did not admit liability, highlighting the complexity of bankruptcy proceedings where liability and asset availability are often contentious. The case underscores the legal implications of corporate governance failures and the potential for personal liability among directors. 

In conclusion, this situation illustrates the intersection of bankruptcy law and allegations of fraud, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in corporate management. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Hin-Leongs-founder-OK-Lim-children-declared-bankrupt)\]
