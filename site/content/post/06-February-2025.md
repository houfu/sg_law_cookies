In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
A tale of bonds and borders played.    
From Singapore's shores to Swiss domains,    
Investors seek redress for financial pains.    
While words of discord face the gavel's might,    
Harmony's call echoes through the night.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the execution of Iskandar Rahmat, a former police officer in Singapore, convicted for the 2013 double murder of a father and son. 

Iskandar was sentenced to death in 2015 after a trial that established his intent to kill, despite his claims of self-defense. The Court of Appeal upheld his conviction, emphasizing the premeditated nature of the crime, as evidenced by the multiple stab wounds inflicted on the victims. His subsequent appeals and complaints against his legal representation were dismissed, reinforcing the principle that capital punishment is reserved for the most heinous crimes.

In conclusion, this case underscores the rigorous judicial process in capital cases and the high threshold for overturning convictions in Singapore. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-hangs-ex-cop-found-guilty-of-2013-Kovan-double-murder)\]

The article discusses the suspension of psychiatrist Ang Yong Guan for professional misconduct related to the overprescription of medication that contributed to a patient's death. 

Dr. Ang received a three-year suspension after being found guilty of three charges, particularly for a final prescription that significantly exceeded safe dosage limits of mirtazapine and zolpidem. The court emphasized the grave risks associated with his actions, which deviated from established medical guidelines, and noted his failure to inform the patient of the potential dangers. 

This case underscores the importance of adherence to medical standards and the responsibilities of healthcare professionals, particularly those in senior positions. The ruling serves as a reminder of the potential legal repercussions of negligence in medical practice.

In conclusion, the case highlights the critical need for physicians to balance treatment efficacy with patient safety, reinforcing the legal principle that patient welfare must always be prioritized. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Psychiatrist-Ang-Yong-Guan-suspended-for-overprescribing-medication-to-patient-who-later-died)\]

The article discusses Singapore's proactive stance on combating social media manipulation during the upcoming general election (GE), emphasizing the application of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (Fica) and the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma). 

Key legal aspects include the government's authority to address foreign interference through Fica, particularly against hostile information campaigns, and the ability to issue directives under Pofma to rectify falsehoods disseminated online. Additionally, the article highlights recent legislation aimed at preventing deepfakes during elections, reinforcing the legal framework against misinformation.

In conclusion, the government's commitment to engage with social media companies and academics signals a comprehensive approach to safeguarding electoral integrity, with significant implications for compliance and enforcement in the digital landscape. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Spore-will-use-Fica-and-Pofma-if-there-is-social-media-manipulation-during-GE-Sun-Xueling)\]

The article discusses the establishment of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) and its implications for Singapore-headquartered firms. Minister Alvin Tan highlights that the JS-SEZ will enable these companies to expand manufacturing and processing operations in Johor while retaining headquarters in Singapore.

Key legal aspects include the introduction of favorable tax incentives from Malaysia, such as a reduced corporate tax rate of 5% for up to 15 years for qualifying investments. This move aims to attract investments in high-value sectors like AI and aerospace. The Singapore government emphasizes its competitive advantages, including a strong legal framework and political stability, which are difficult to replicate.

In conclusion, the JS-SEZ presents opportunities for cross-border business expansion while raising questions about potential sectoral impacts and competition. Legal practitioners should monitor these developments for implications on corporate structuring and investment strategies. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-headquartered-firms-can-use-Johor-Singapore-SEZ-as-manufacturing-base-Alvin-Tan)\]

The article discusses a significant legal action initiated by over 500 investors, primarily from Singapore, against the Swiss government concerning substantial losses from Credit Suisse’s Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds. 

The key legal aspects include the invocation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs), which obligate Switzerland to protect investors’ rights and ensure fair treatment. This marks a historic claim as it is the largest investment treaty claim against Switzerland, with losses estimated at US$250 million. The investors have submitted trigger letters, a necessary precursor to arbitration, and will engage in negotiations over the next six months.

In conclusion, this case could set a precedent for future investor-state disputes, particularly regarding the treatment of bondholders during financial crises. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Over-500-investors-including-300-Singaporeans-kick-off-claim-against-Switzerland-over-Credit-Suisse-bond-losses-of-over-US250-million)\]

The article discusses the dismissal of rapper Subhas Nair's appeal against his conviction for promoting ill will between racial and religious groups in Singapore, leading to a six-week prison sentence.

Nair faced four charges stemming from his social media posts and performances that were deemed inflammatory. His defense argued that he lacked malicious intent and highlighted perceived inequalities in law enforcement. However, Justice Hoo Sheau Peng upheld the lower court's ruling, stating that intent is not a necessary element under the law. The judge emphasized the significant potential harm of online communications, particularly concerning sensitive racial and religious matters, reinforcing the importance of deterrence.

In conclusion, this case underscores the legal implications of online speech in Singapore, particularly regarding racial harmony, and the judiciary's stance on maintaining social order. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Rapper-Subhas-Nairs-appeal-dismissed-starts-jail-term-for-trying-to-promote-ill-will-between-groups)\]
