Dr. Yeo Khee Hong, a doctor with over 40 years of experience, has been suspended from practice for a year after misdiagnosing a teenage patient, resulting in the loss of the patient's left testicle. The doctor initially diagnosed the patient with an infection and inflammation of the testicle when the patient was actually suffering from testicular torsion. The Singapore Medical Council disciplinary tribunal found that if the doctor had referred the patient to the emergency room or a specialist during the first consultation, there was a significant chance of salvaging the testicle. In addition to the suspension, Dr. Yeo was censured and ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings.

Takeaway: This case highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely referral in medical practice. Failing to consider all possible diagnoses and refer patients to specialists can result in severe consequences for patients and may lead to disciplinary action against doctors. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Doctor-suspended-a-year-for-misdiagnosis-caused-teenager-to-lose-a-testicle)\]

The Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore has stated that it will take enforcement or regulatory action against doctors and dentists who act unprofessionally when issuing medical certificates (MCs). The MOH will also refer errant practitioners to their respective professional watchdogs for further action. The decision comes in response to feedback from employers, government agencies, and schools regarding the excessive issuance of MCs, particularly through telemedicine. The MOH plans to amend the Healthcare Services Act to require that every MC includes the name and medical registration number of the issuing practitioner. The proposed amendment aims to ensure that MCs are issued only after medical or dental care has been provided to the patient. The tightening of MC issuance rules has sparked debate among employers and employees, with concerns raised about the potential impact on genuinely sick individuals and the potential abuse of MCs due to poor workplace conditions. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/MOH-will-take-action-against-doctors-dentists-who-act-unprofessionally-when-issuing-MCs)\]
