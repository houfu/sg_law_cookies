In courts where justice seeks its claim,<br>  
Fraud's shadow looms, a billion's game.<br>  
Transport's pulse, under watchful eyes,<br>  
Laws weave tight, as security ties.<br>  
Words wield power, reputations sway,<br>  
In truth's embrace, the scales must lay.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the ongoing trial of Ng Yu Zhi, accused of orchestrating a $1.46 billion nickel-trading scam that defrauded numerous investors, including former Envy director Lau Lee Sheng and his family, who lost over $40 million.

Key legal aspects include Ng facing 108 charges, with 42 being prosecuted in the current trial, covering serious offenses such as cheating, forgery, and money laundering. Lau's testimony reveals the emotional and financial toll on victims, highlighting the potential for claims against him by liquidators seeking to recover over $17 million in commissions, despite his non-complicit status.

The case underscores the legal ramifications of investment fraud and the complexities of liability for individuals involved in fraudulent schemes. 

In conclusion, this trial serves as a critical reminder of the risks associated with investment schemes and the necessity for due diligence in financial dealings. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/World-came-crashing-down-Former-Envy-director-and-family-invested-more-than-40m-in-nickel-scam)\]

The article discusses the implementation of the Transport Sector (Critical Firms) Act, which imposes greater regulatory controls on 19 key transport entities in Singapore, including Singapore Airlines (SIA) and SBS Transit. 

Key legal aspects include the law's aim to mitigate risks from adverse influences and service interruptions by granting government authorities enhanced oversight. Designated firms must notify and obtain approval for significant ownership or leadership changes and report events that could disrupt essential services. The Transport Minister is empowered to intervene in extreme cases, appointing competent managers if necessary.

In conclusion, this law strengthens regulatory frameworks for critical transport firms, ensuring national security and service reliability in Singapore's transport sector. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SIA-SBS-Transit-PSA-among-19-key-transport-entities-to-face-greater-controls-under-new-law)\]

UOB has announced plans to sue former Yang Kee Logistics CEO Ken Koh, along with The Online Citizen (TOC) and its editor, over allegations of improper conduct and defamation. The bank asserts that Koh's accusations, made in a statutory declaration, are baseless and have caused reputational harm. UOB's legal action follows its denial of the allegations, which relate to a property sale and breach of confidential information from 2016. The case raises issues of defamation law, the responsibilities of media outlets in reporting allegations, and the implications of statutory declarations. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is also investigating the matter. 

In conclusion, this case underscores the delicate balance between free speech and reputational protection in the context of corporate governance. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/UOB-to-sue-ex-CEO-of-former-client-Yang-Kee-Logistics-The-Online-Citizen-and-its-editor)\]
