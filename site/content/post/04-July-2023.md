The law targets discrimination, encourages amicable resolution, and aims to be completed by 2024. Penalties will be based on the severity of the offense, and protection against retaliation will be included. Small firms may initially be exempt, but this exemption may be tightened in five years. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Spore-workplace-discrimination-law-to-promote-settling-disputes-through-mediation-Koh-Poh-Koon)\]
