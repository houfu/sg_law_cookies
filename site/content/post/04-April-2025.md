In courts where justice seeks its way,    
Fraud's shadow looms, a billion's sway.    
Crypto's fall, founders evade,    
Dementia's grip, crimes remade.    
Balance teeters, truth unfurls,    
In legal tides, the world whirls.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the ongoing trial of Ng Yu Zhi, accused of orchestrating a $1.45 billion nickel trading scam that defrauded numerous investors, including prominent venture capitalist Dr. Finian Tan. 

Key legal aspects include the nature of the charges against Ng, which encompass cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, money laundering, and fraudulent trading. The prosecution is focusing on 42 of the 108 charges in this trial. Dr. Tan's testimony reveals how Ng allegedly manipulated perceptions of his success to secure investments under false pretenses, raising questions about due diligence and investor protection in venture capital.

In conclusion, this case highlights the critical importance of thorough vetting in investment opportunities and the legal ramifications of fraudulent misrepresentation in financial dealings. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/145b-nickel-scam-Venture-capitalist-says-he-was-impressed-when-he-first-met-alleged-scammer)\]

The article discusses the appeal by Three Arrows Capital founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies to set aside court summons related to their failed cryptocurrency hedge fund. 

Key legal aspects include the founders' argument that they were cooperating with liquidators and the claim of improper service of summons. Their counsel contends that the summons were directed at 3AC, not the individuals, and highlights the lack of proper notice. Conversely, the liquidators assert that attempts were made to serve notice, with evidence of the founders' evasiveness. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon expressed skepticism about the foundersâ€™ commitment to the proceedings, emphasizing their delay in filing appeals.

In conclusion, the outcome of this case may hinge on interpretations of service and cooperation, potentially impacting future liquidations in the cryptocurrency sector. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Three-Arrows-founders-appeal-to-have-court-summons-set-aside)\]

The article discusses the legal challenges posed by dementia patients who commit crimes, emphasizing the need for a balance between public safety and recognizing diminished culpability due to mental impairment. 

Key legal aspects include the acknowledgment that dementia can impair impulse control and judgment, raising questions about criminal responsibility. Courts may consider whether offenders can appreciate the wrongfulness of their actions, potentially influencing sentencing and rehabilitation options. The article cites past cases, such as Lim See Poi and Yong Kok Kwong, illustrating how judges navigate these complexities.

In conclusion, as dementia prevalence increases, legal systems must adapt to address the nuances of criminal responsibility and rehabilitation for offenders with neurodegenerative conditions, advocating for a compassionate yet just approach. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/How-to-deal-with-dementia-patients-who-break-the-law-Opinion)\]
