In courts where justice seeks its claim,    
Fraud's shadow looms, a tarnished name.    
Regulators rise, with watchful eyes,    
To guard the truth from deceit's disguise.    
In finance's realm, standards stand tall,    
Ensuring trust, lest ethics fall.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.

This article discusses the need for regulatory oversight in the training of financial professionals in Singapore, particularly concerning unregulated trainers lacking financial qualifications. 

Key legal aspects include the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) recent stance on licensing financial influencers, emphasizing the necessity for qualified individuals to provide financial advice. The Insurance and Financial Practitioners Association of Singapore (Ifpas) advocates for setting minimum standards for trainers, monitoring training content, and establishing regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical practices in financial training. This aligns with MASâ€™ guidelines and aims to protect consumer interests.

In conclusion, the call for regulation of training practices highlights the importance of maintaining professional standards in the financial advisory sector, reinforcing the need for accountability among trainers. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Look-into-training-of-financial-professionals-by-those-who-are-not-financially-trained-Forum)\]
