Singapore's PCA applies to citizens who commit corruption offences abroad, including abettors. Silence or wilful blindness to corruption can be interpreted as approval or knowledge of wrongdoing. The Attorney-General exercises prosecutorial discretion. Cooperation and full disclosure are the best strategies for those under investigation. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/How-Singapores-corruption-law-applies-abroad-to-businesses-individuals-and-why-those-under-probe-should-comply-with-CPIB-Explainer)\]

Singapore is introducing new laws to counter workplace discrimination, which will protect against the most commonly reported grounds of discrimination. The legislation will provide clear legal terms on what is and what is not considered discrimination, particularly in the workplace, and allow younger workers to enter the workforce with confidence. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/What-Singapores-impending-workplace-discrimination-law-means-for-younger-future-workers-Commentary)\]
