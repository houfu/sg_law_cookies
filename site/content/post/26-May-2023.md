In the world of law, news never sleeps,  
From AI art to failed startups' weeps,  
Hin Leong's tycoon and his paper trail,  
Legal battles that never seem to pale,  
Stay tuned for updates, the stories unveil.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


DBS Bank employees using an AI tool to generate art has caused outrage among local artists. The AI tool, Midjourney, creates images based on the artwork of many artists who have not consented for their works to be used. Copyright infringement still happens in the machine training process. Some artists oppose AI in art, while others view it as an opportunity for collaboration. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/AI-generated-artwork-by-bank-employees-raises-questions-of-copyright-and-artistic-licence)\]

Former Hin Leong oil tycoon Lim Oon Kuin did not use a computer and relied on staff to bring him hard copy printouts of the firm's cash flow position. The prosecution sought to establish the tasks and processes involved in the accounts department. The hearing will continue until July 20. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/OK-Lim-relied-on-hard-copy-printouts-from-staff-as-he-did-not-use-a-computer-witness)\]

Failed grocery delivery startup honestbee's former staff and trade creditors will not receive any of the S$319.9 million owed to them. The sole secured creditor, Formation Group, has recovered about S$700,000 from the startup's assets. Honestbee's liquidator, BDO, has only managed to recover about S$720. The liquidator is set to apply to the High Court to dissolve honestbee. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Honestbee-ex-staff-trade-creditors-wont-get-any-of-the-S320-million-owed)\]
