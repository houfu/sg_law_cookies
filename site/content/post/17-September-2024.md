In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
Corruption's shadow fades, acquittals made.    
AI's dawn in legal halls, swift and bright,    
Research realms transformed by digital light.    
Markets pulse with newfound clarity,    
Law's future shaped by tech's prosperity.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


In a recent legal development, Mr. Tan Siam Chua, an HDB senior estate manager, and Mr. Liong Ah Chye, a construction firm director, have been granted a discharge amounting to acquittal for corruption charges. This means they cannot be retried for the same offenses. The prosecution withdrew charges after determining that while evidence of wrongdoing existed, it did not affect HDB's decision-making. Both men expressed relief, with Tan seeking reinstatement at HDB. This case underscores the importance of prosecutorial discretion and the implications of evidence in corruption cases. 

The key takeaway is the impact of prosecutorial decisions on employment and reputations in public service. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/HDB-manager-construction-firm-director-accused-of-corruption-get-discharge-amounting-to-acquittal)\]

The article discusses Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo)'s initiative to refine its approach to querying listed companies, aiming to reduce operational frictions and enable value-driven actions. Key legal aspects include balancing material information disclosure with uninterrupted trading, thus fostering a reliable market environment. The SGX's focus on enhancing board effectiveness and market discipline reflects its commitment to a vibrant equities market. The implications suggest a potential increase in market activity and improved liquidity. Overall, SGX RegCo's efforts may significantly impact how companies engage with the market, enhancing their capital-raising opportunities. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SGX-RegCo-to-review-how-and-when-it-queries-listed-companies)\]

The article discusses the transformative impact of AI on the legal field, particularly highlighting the introduction of LawNet AI in Singapore, which allows lawyers to efficiently research 15,000 case judgments. This innovation is part of a broader trend, as a LexisNexis survey indicates that 62% of UK law firms have adapted operations due to generative AI. Key legal implications include enhanced efficiency in legal research and the potential redefinition of legal roles. With safeguards against AI inaccuracies, LawNet AI promises significant advancements in legal practice, particularly in dispute resolution and litigation. The adoption of such technologies marks a pivotal shift in delivering legal services. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/AI-adoption-in-legal-field-will-have-a-big-impact-Forum)\]
