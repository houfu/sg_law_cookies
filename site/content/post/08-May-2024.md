  "In the web of laws, where secrets twine,  
  Cyber threats loom, in the digital shrine.  
  Money's dark dance, assets seized in time,  
  In the court's stern gaze, a coach's crime.  
  Private capital's surge, a lucrative sign,  
  In the world's grand stage, these stories align."

"In the web of laws, where secrets twine,  
Cyber threats loom, in the digital shrine.  
Money's dark dance, assets seized in time,  
In the court's stern gaze, a coach's crime.  
Private capital's surge, a lucrative sign,  
In the world's grand stage, these stories align."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Singapore government has passed a bill to expand the oversight of the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) over critical computer systems at high risk of cyber attacks. The amendment to the Cybersecurity Act aims to keep pace with evolving technology and business models that rely on outsourced digital services. Under the new law, operators of critical information infrastructure (CII) will need to declare any cyber security outages or attacks that affect their services. The CSA will also be able to designate entities of cyber security interest for auditing and regulate third-party vendors. The expanded oversight is necessary as threats become more complex with increased digitalisation. 

In conclusion, Singapore has amended its cyber security law to strengthen oversight of critical computer systems at high risk of cyber attacks. The Cyber Security Agency will have expanded powers to regulate operators of critical information infrastructure and audited entities of cyber security interest. The new law also addresses the responsibility of providers of essential services to ensure the cyber security of computer systems they rely on. This amendment is in line with similar approaches taken by other countries to address the increasing cyber security risks in the digital age. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Spore-amends-cyber-security-law-to-boost-oversight-of-national-interests-essential-services)\]

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is working with DBS Bank to address recent disruptions to its internet banking and payment services and ensure the identification of the root cause. Despite progress, DBS's remediation plan for the 2023 disruptions is still ongoing. The MAS will continue to monitor DBS's progress and the effectiveness of implemented measures. Additional capital requirements imposed on the bank as a result of the disruptions will remain until the MAS is satisfied with DBS's ability to maintain service availability and handle disruptions effectively. IT experts highlight various potential causes for the outages, including software misconfigurations and human errors. Improving digital infrastructure and establishing digital trust are essential for widespread adoption of cashless transactions.

A basketball coach in Singapore has been sentenced to 19 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane for sexually abusing four teenage boys between the ages of 13 and 16. The coach exploited his position of authority to commit the offenses, using tactics such as pretexting "puberty checks" and pressuring the victims with threats of being dropped from the school team. The coach, who cannot be named due to a gag order, had been a registered coach since 2012. The case highlights the vulnerability of young athletes and the importance of safeguarding measures in sports organizations.

Takeaway: This case underscores the need for robust child protection policies in sports organizations and the importance of vigilant supervision and training for coaches and staff. It also serves as a reminder for parents and guardians to have open conversations with young athletes about personal boundaries and the importance of reporting any inappropriate behavior. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Basketball-coach-who-sexually-abused-4-teen-boys-gets-19-years-jail-and-caning)\]
