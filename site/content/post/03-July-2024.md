"Through the lens of law, tales of justice unfurl,  
In Singapore's courts, where truth's flag is unfurled.  
From money laundering to a teen's violent act,  
To food donations, each story is a fact.  
In the dance of justice, where the world's stories twirl,  
In the heart of law, the news summary whirls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A 73-year-old woman in Singapore has been sentenced to 17 years and 10 months in jail for her involvement in the abuse of an intellectually disabled woman. Hasmah Sulong and her family treated the victim as a slave, subjecting her to horrific acts such as knocking out her teeth with a hammer, digging a finger into her eye until it bled, and chaining her to a toilet bowl. The victim suffered head injuries, burns, blurred vision, and the loss of teeth as a result. Hasmah pleaded guilty to five charges and is the last family member to be convicted. The other family members involved in the case have already been sentenced. The judge described the offenses as horrific and noted that Hasmah had betrayed the victim's trust and forced her into servitude. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Over-17-years-jail-for-woman-73-who-abused-family-friend-almost-to-death)\]

Singapore's Foreign Minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, stated in Parliament that Singapore is prepared in principle to recognize Palestine as a state at an appropriate time. The key consideration for recognition is that it should contribute to the progress towards peace and a negotiated two-state solution. Balakrishnan emphasized the need for an effective Palestinian government that accepts Israel's right to exist and rejects terrorism. Singapore has consistently supported a negotiated two-state solution and has provided technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority as part of its commitment to capacity building and development. Singapore will continue to offer support to both Palestinians and Israelis in their pursuit of peace. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-prepared-in-principle-to-recognise-Palestine-as-a-state-at-appropriate-time-Vivian)\]

The Singapore government has proposed enhanced anti-money laundering laws that would allow government agencies to share data with each other, enabling faster investigations of money laundering cases. The proposed amendments include allowing the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore and Singapore Customs to share tax and trade data with the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO). The Bill also aims to simplify the prosecution of offenses that occurred overseas by requiring only that the money launderer knew or believed they were dealing with criminal proceeds. Additionally, the amendments would enable investigations into foreign environmental crimes linked to money laundering and improve processes for dealing with seized properties. The Bill also proposes lowering the threshold for casino operators to perform checks on patrons for potential money laundering activities. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Enhanced-anti-money-laundering-laws-proposed-govt-agencies-to-share-more-data-with-each-other)\]

In Singapore's largest money laundering case, no foreign claims have been made for the $944 million in cash and assets that were forfeited by the 10 individuals convicted. The assets include luxury cars, property, watches, handbags, jewelry, alcohol, and Bearbrick ornaments. The Ministry of Home Affairs stated that no foreign governments or agencies have made competing claims for the assets. However, foreign jurisdictions can request mutual legal assistance if they believe they have a claim. The forfeited assets and cash will go into the Consolidated Fund, which is used for government expenditures. The case highlights the effectiveness of Singapore's anti-money laundering laws and the growing challenge of identifying illicit fund flows in an increasingly digitalized world.

Takeaway: In Singapore's largest money laundering case, no foreign claims have been made for the forfeited cash and assets worth $944 million, highlighting the effectiveness of the country's anti-money laundering laws. The case also underscores the challenge of differentiating between legitimate and illicit fund flows in an increasingly digitalized financial landscape. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/No-foreign-claims-for-944m-in-cash-and-assets-forfeited-in-largest-money-laundering-case)\]

A proposed law in Singapore, known as the Good Samaritan Food Donation Bill, aims to encourage more food donations and protect businesses and caterers from being sued if a recipient gets food poisoning. Under the proposed law, businesses can donate unsold or excess food as long as it is safe and suitable for consumption, and specific hygiene and safety protocols are followed. The donor must provide instructions on how to handle the food, including storage and consumption time limits. If all conditions are met, the donor will not be held responsible for any food poisoning incidents. Similar food donation laws exist in countries like the United States, France, and Italy. The proposed law will be debated in Parliament at a later sitting. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Food-donation-Bill-tabled-to-protect-businesses-caterers-from-being-sued)\]

A teenager who killed his schoolmate with an axe in 2021 is appealing against his sentence of 16 years' jail. The assailant, who was 16 at the time of the crime, pleaded guilty to culpable homicide. During the appeal, the teen's lawyer argued that his client's sentence was crushing and that his culpability should be calibrated in the context of his depression. The prosecution argued that the teen had significant responsibility for his actions and had made the decision to watch snuff videos, which influenced his irrational plan. The Court of Appeal will make a decision on the case. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Teen-who-killed-River-Valley-High-schoolmate-with-axe-in-2021-appeals-against-sentence)\]
