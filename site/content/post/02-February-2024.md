"In the court's stern gaze, Shopee's plea unfurls,  
Yet the judge dismisses, as the verdict whirls.  
Amidst the city's lights, where the funfair twirls,  
New laws arise, as caution unfurls.  
In retail's realm, a code of conduct swirls,  
Balancing scales, as a new era unfurls."

The judge ruled that the information the employee acquired during regular meetings did not constitute confidential information that would prevent him from working for a competitor.

Starting from March 1, amusement centres and fun fair operators in Singapore will face substantial penalties if they offer high-value prizes that make playing parlour games similar to gambling. The Ministry of Home Affairs has introduced new rules under the Public Entertainments Act, including fines of up to S$20,000 and the potential suspension or revocation of public entertainment licenses. Operators may also be held liable for conducting unlawful gambling, which carries penalties of a fine of up to S$500,000 and a maximum jail term of seven years. These measures aim to prevent gambling inducement, particularly among vulnerable individuals like youths. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Errant-amusement-centre-fun-fair-operators-face-hefty-penalties-from-March-1-under-rules-to-ban-high-value-game-prizes)\]

A new law in Singapore, the Lease Agreements for Retail Premises Act 2023, has made it mandatory for all retail leases to comply with an industry-wide code of conduct. The code includes 13 leasing principles that aim to create fairer lease negotiations between landlords and tenants. The code prohibits landlords from terminating leases unless for redevelopment works and requires a gross turnover rent component when rent exceeds a specific amount. The code applies to all qualifying retail leases with a tenure of at least one year signed or renewed from February 1, 2023. The law also establishes a dispute resolution framework and a Fair Tenancy Industry Committee to maintain and promote compliance with the code. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-law-mandating-retail-leases-comply-with-code-of-conduct-takes-effect)\]
