"In the dance of law, where justice twirls,  
Through the digital age, a new program unfurls.  
In the court's stern gaze, a trial whirls,  
While non-compete clauses, around careers, they curl.  
In the world's grand stage, the news summary swirls,  
Crafting tales of change, as the day unfurls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Singapore Academy of Law is launching a new training program for young lawyers in response to the increasing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital tools on the legal profession. The Junior Lawyers Professional Certification Programme (JLP) will focus on developing analytical and problem-solving skills through scenario-based learning and simulation exercises. The program aims to prepare young lawyers to compete and advance in a digital economy while also ensuring they understand the underlying legal principles that may not be answered by technology. The academy will seek input from senior members of the profession to develop the curriculum and emphasize the importance of preparing young lawyers for the digital age.

This article discusses the challenges faced by companies in preventing former star employees from competing. In order to hold a departing employee accountable for causing losses, companies must provide evidence of illegal acts such as stealing and misusing confidential business data. The law also protects employees' rights to use skills and knowledge acquired during their employment. In a recent case in Singapore, a company failed to prove that its former general manager misused confidential information or conspired against the company's interests. The judge described the company's case as weak and ordered the employee to pay only nominal compensation. The article concludes with three important lessons for employers and employees regarding their rights and responsibilities during a career switch. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Hard-for-companies-to-prevent-former-star-employees-from-competing)\]

MoneySmart, a personal finance portal, has failed to prevent a former executive from working for a rival firm due to an unreasonable non-compete clause and confidentiality clause in the employment contract. The High Court ruled that the non-compete clause was too broad and not in the public interest, and the confidentiality clause lacked specificity. The court stated that restraint of trade clauses are unenforceable unless the employer can prove otherwise. This case highlights the importance of drafting reasonable and specific non-compete and confidentiality clauses in employment contracts.

Takeaway: Employers should ensure that non-compete and confidentiality clauses in employment contracts are reasonable, specific, and protect legitimate proprietary interests. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/MoneySmart-fails-to-stop-former-exec-from-working-for-rival-court-says-non-compete-clause-unreasonable)\]
