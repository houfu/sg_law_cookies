In Singapore's courts, justice sways,    
Where data breaches and divorce delays,    
Guardians of youth, app stores stand,    
Protecting innocence with a firm hand.    
In family ties, contributions weigh,    
As laws shape lives in a modern way.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


**Summary of Singapore's New App Store Regulations for Youth Protection**

Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) will implement a new code on March 31, 2025, mandating app stores to screen users under 18 from downloading adult apps. This regulation aims to protect children from harmful content, similar to existing social media regulations. Key provisions include community standards enforcement, prompt response to user reports, and potential fines of up to $1 million for non-compliance.

The effectiveness of age verification methods is crucial, with concerns about privacy and the accuracy of technology like AI and facial recognition. This initiative reflects a growing global trend towards stricter online content regulations for minors.

**Conclusion:** The new code positions app stores as gatekeepers, enhancing youth protection online while raising important questions about implementation and privacy. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-reins-in-app-stores-to-protect-the-young)\]

This article discusses a High Court ruling in Singapore regarding the financial implications for self-employed spouses who fail to contribute to family expenses during a marriage. The case highlights how financial contributions, or lack thereof, can significantly affect the division of matrimonial assets upon divorce.

Key legal aspects include:

1. **Matrimonial Asset Division**: The court ruled that the husband, who contributed minimally to family expenses and had failed business ventures, was awarded only 15% of the matrimonial assets, while the wife received 85%. This emphasizes the importance of financial contributions in asset division.

2. **Child Maintenance Obligations**: The judge reinforced that both parents share responsibility for child support, rejecting the husband's argument to reduce payments based on his unsuccessful business efforts. This establishes a precedent for equitable child maintenance expectations regardless of employment status.

3. **Timing of Asset Valuation**: The ruling clarified that the division of matrimonial assets is based on the date of the interim judgment, meaning any income or expenses incurred after that date are not included in the asset pool.

4. **Evidence of Contributions**: The case underscored the necessity of maintaining proper records to substantiate claims of financial contributions, as the wife’s thorough documentation led to her receiving a larger share of the asset division.

In conclusion, this case serves as a reminder for spouses to document their financial contributions and understand their obligations regarding child support and asset division in the event of a divorce. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/When-self-employed-spouses-dont-pay-for-family-expenses)\]

The article discusses how Singaporean law favors parents who invest more time and effort in caring for their children during divorce proceedings. 

Key legal aspects reveal that courts assess both monetary and non-monetary contributions when dividing matrimonial assets. Cases illustrate that primary caregivers, often mothers, receive higher asset shares based on their significant roles in child-rearing and household management. Notable precedents include a wife receiving a 70% indirect contribution ratio due to her sole caregiving role and another awarded 85% of assets for balancing caregiving with being the primary breadwinner.

In conclusion, the article underscores the legal recognition of parental effort, suggesting that active involvement in child-rearing can substantially influence asset division in divorce cases. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Why-the-law-favours-parents-who-spend-more-time-and-effort-on-kids)\]
