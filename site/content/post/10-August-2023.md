## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A former treasurer of the Singapore Chess Federation has won a defamation suit against 21 members who falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. The judge awarded him $120,000 in damages. The trial revealed combative attitudes and disdain from some defendants. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Ex-treasurer-of-chess-body-wins-defamation-suit-over-sexual-misconduct-accusation)\]

SGX is clarifying rules for life sciences companies seeking a mainboard listing, stating they don't need to be revenue generating. The move resolves confusion from 2012 amendments. The Listings Advisory Committee granted an exemption for a potential listing, aiming to encourage more companies to list on SGX. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SGX-to-amend-life-sciences-listing-rules-to-make-revenue-exemption-explicit)\]
