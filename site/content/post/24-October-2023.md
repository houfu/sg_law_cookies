Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In a world of legal twists and turns,  
Where disbarred lawyers' misdeeds churn,  
Jeffrey Ong, once trusted, now confined,  
Ordered to pay, justice aligned.  
Cryptocurrencies, a criminal's disguise,  
Unraveling financial crimes, a constant prize.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Disbarred lawyer Jeffrey Ong Su Aun, who is serving 19 years in jail for misappropriating $76 million, has been ordered by the High Court to pay $6.58 million to Airtrust (Singapore), one of the victims whose funds he siphoned. Airtrust filed a civil claim against Ong and four others to recover its loss. The court also declared that Ong was liable to account to Airtrust for the sum on the ground of his breach of fiduciary or equitable duties. Ong had misappropriated money from five victims, including Airtrust and Allied Tech. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Jailed-ex-lawyer-Jeffrey-Ong-ordered-to-pay-658m-he-misappropriated-from-escrow-account)\]

Digital currencies like cryptocurrencies have made it harder for authorities to trace and detect financial crimes. Criminals use sophisticated tactics to disguise the origin and nature of funds, making it difficult for authorities to detect illicit transfers. Cryptocurrencies offer an easy method to move money out of a country, especially in places with strict capital controls. Unregulated cryptocurrencies allow anyone to move funds without scrutiny. Illicit funds are often transferred through individuals or businesses, with young people and students being targeted as money mules. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and art are also used to move money, and trade-based money laundering methods are employed through over-invoicing or under-invoicing trade transactions. Criminals also use informal value transfer systems and set up companies in jurisdictions with secrecy laws to avoid scrutiny. Financial crime experts acknowledge that it is challenging to unravel criminal connections, and financial systems will continue to be tested by money laundering. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/From-briefcase-of-cash-to-virtual-wallets-Why-financial-crimes-are-harder-to-trace)\]
