In courts where justice weighs the past and pain,<br>  
A cyclist's fate and driver's care remain.<br>  
Social screens, a youthful mind's delight,<br>  
Yet laws must guide the digital night.<br>  
Through tangled roads and virtual streams,<br>  
Balance and truth weave through our dreams.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


This article discusses a recent court ruling involving a driver, Ms. Lee Sim Leng, who sued SMRT Buses for over $5 million following a car accident. The court ultimately awarded her $17,373.16, finding that her neck injuries were primarily due to a pre-existing condition, cervical spondylosis, rather than the accident itself.

The judicial commissioner, Alex Wong, emphasized that while Ms. Lee genuinely believed the accident caused her injuries, the evidence indicated otherwise. He criticized SMRT Buses for labeling her as an opportunist and acknowledged the psychological complexities of her case, including her long-standing major depressive disorder, which was exacerbated but not caused by the accident. The ruling highlighted the importance of distinguishing between pre-existing conditions and injuries directly resulting from accidents, setting a precedent for future personal injury claims.

In conclusion, this case underscores the need for thorough medical evaluations in personal injury claims, particularly when pre-existing conditions are involved, and illustrates the court's sensitivity to the psychological impacts of such injuries. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Driver-injured-in-crash-involving-bus-awarded-17k-after-suing-SMRT-Buses-for-5m)\]

This article discusses a court case involving a driver, Ian Tai Zhi Jian, who ran a red light, colliding with a cyclist, Eugene Sng Jin He, who was also violating traffic rules by crossing against a red pedestrian signal. Tai was fined $4,800 and disqualified from driving for five years, despite the severity of the cyclist's injuries, due to the unique circumstances of shared negligence.

Key legal aspects include Tai's guilty plea for driving without due care, which typically carries a potential jail term of up to two years. The prosecution opted against seeking imprisonment, considering the cyclist's concurrent violation of traffic laws. The case underscores the principle of comparative negligence, where both parties share responsibility for the accident, impacting the severity of penalties.

In conclusion, this case highlights the complexities of traffic law where multiple violations can mitigate penalties, emphasizing the need for careful assessment of all contributing factors in road traffic incidents. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Fine-for-driver-who-ran-red-light-and-hit-cyclist-who-also-flouted-traffic-rules)\]

This article discusses the implications of addressing social media addiction among young users in Singapore, particularly in light of proposed bans on social media for those under 16. 

The author argues that rather than imposing a blanket ban, which may be ineffective, the focus should be on the underlying addictive features of social media platforms. Legal considerations include potential regulatory measures that could be implemented to mitigate these addictive elements, such as restrictions on notifications and content algorithms. 

The takeaway is that effective regulation should balance the need for mental health protection with the benefits of social media as a communication tool, suggesting a nuanced approach to legislation rather than outright bans. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Take-steps-to-tackle-root-causes-of-social-media-addiction-Forum)\]
