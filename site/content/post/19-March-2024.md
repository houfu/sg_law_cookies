"In the dance of justice, where verdicts twirl,  
In Singapore's heart, tales of law unfurl.  
From town council fees to the gambler's pearl,  
To concert scams in the pop star's whirl.  
In this world stage, as stories twirl,  
Echoes of truth, in each news pearl."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A woman in Singapore has been convicted for failing to pay service and conservancy charges to her town council amounting to $565.50. The woman stopped paying the charges because the town council did not remove shoes and potted plants placed by her neighbors along the common corridor. Under the Town Councils Act, failure to pay charges within 14 days of a written demand is a strict liability offense punishable by a fine of up to $1,000. The judge emphasized that residents cannot refuse to pay charges based on personal expectations, as the fees contribute to the maintenance of common property. 

The main legal aspect of this article is the application of the Town Councils Act, which imposes a strict liability offense on individuals who fail to pay charges to the town council within the specified timeframe. The case highlights the importance of adhering to payment obligations and the consequences of non-payment. The judge's ruling emphasizes that personal satisfaction or grievances cannot be used as a basis for refusing to pay the charges, as they contribute to the maintenance of common property. This case serves as a precedent for the strict enforcement of payment obligations to town councils. 

In conclusion, this article highlights the conviction of a woman for failing to pay town council charges and underscores the strict liability nature of the offense.

A Malaysian man, Chai Hee Keong, has been sentenced to a year and 10 months' jail for his involvement in a syndicate that unlawfully recorded cards during baccarat games at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) casino in Singapore. This case is believed to be the first of its kind in Singaporean courts. Chai is the third person to be convicted in this case, with the syndicate winning a total of $433,730 at the tables from December 16 to 23, 2022. The syndicate's strategy involved a "sorcerer" who wore a concealed Bluetooth earphone and relayed card information to a "marksman" who fed the information into an Excel spreadsheet formula to predict the game's outcome. Chai was assigned as a "tank" and placed high bets based on instructions from the sorcerer. Three other Taiwanese individuals are also said to be involved in the syndicate. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Jail-for-third-man-linked-to-group-that-won-over-433k-at-MBS-casino-by-recording-cards)\]

CCTV footage showed the man pushing the concertgoer through the turnstile gate. This is the first concluded prosecution related to Taylor Swift's concert in Singapore, and other criminal cases, including ticket scams and trespassing, have also been linked to the event. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Man-jailed-after-attempt-to-get-VIP-to-tailgate-at-Taylor-Swift-concert)\]
