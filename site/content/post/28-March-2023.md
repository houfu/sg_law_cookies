## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Suwandi Marchuke is on trial for allegedly misappropriating $470,000 from 218 people who signed up for an umrah package. He is accused of criminal breach of trust and aiding an unlicensed travel agent. The accused allegedly used the collected funds for business investments. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Pilgrimage-package-Man-accused-of-misappropriating-470k-from-customers)\]

Investors holding AT1 bonds may face difficulty getting their money back if there are clauses in the bond's contracts that allow the bondholders' priority to be revoked in the event of a restructuring. Credit Suisse's AT1 perpetual bonds had such a clause, resulting in the Swiss government writing off $17bn of Credit Suisse perpetual bonds. Lawyers expect investors to challenge the decision in cross-border litigation or international arbitration. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/AT1-bondholders-have-little-room-for-recourse-if-enterprise-fails-Lawyers)\]

Singaporean police arrested 23 men in an operation targeting online child sexual exploitation. The men are suspected of possessing, distributing and accessing child abuse material. Electronic devices were seized, and some men were referred to the Home Team Community Assistance and Referral Scheme. Convictions for these crimes can result in up to seven years in jail, fines, or caning. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/23-arrested-in-op-against-online-child-sexual-exploitation-activities)\]
