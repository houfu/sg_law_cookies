In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
Sham vows and market games displayed.    
Urgency in laws swiftly penned,    
Data breaches call for trust to mend.    
In shadows of the legal dance,    
Truth and policy find their stance.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A recent Singapore High Court ruling voided the marriage of a man who died in 2017, following a lawsuit by his mother against the man’s Vietnamese “wife.” The court determined that the marriage was a sham, emphasizing public policy concerns regarding the inheritance of assets by individuals involved in fraudulent unions.

The judge, Justice Choo Han Teck, ruled that allowing the “spouse” of a sham marriage to inherit would exploit state benefits and undermine legitimate beneficiaries' rights. The decision hinged on evidence that the couple lived separately and had no genuine relationship, with the mother proving her case on a balance of probabilities.

This ruling underscores the judiciary's stance against marriage fraud, reinforcing the importance of genuine marital intent in asset inheritance. Moving forward, it sets a precedent for similar cases involving sham marriages, potentially influencing future litigation and enforcement against marriage-of-convenience schemes.

In conclusion, the case highlights the legal ramifications of sham marriages in Singapore and the court's commitment to uphold public policy and protect legitimate beneficiaries. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Judge-voids-marriage-of-man-who-died-in-2017-after-mum-sues-Vietnamese-wifeutm-sourceslw-edmamputm-mediumheadlinesamputm-campaign-45720-slw-edm-headlines-amputm-id45720)\]

The article discusses the swift legislative action taken by the Singapore government to block the Allianz-Income insurance deal through the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, highlighting the use of a certificate of urgency for expedited passage. 

Key legal aspects include the Minister's assertion that such measures are rare and reserved for pressing circumstances, countering concerns raised about potential reputational damage to Parliament. The debate underscores the tension between legislative efficiency and thorough scrutiny, as critics argue that bypassing a select committee may undermine democratic processes. Precedents cited include previous urgent bills related to the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrating the government's commitment to agility in exceptional situations.

In conclusion, the article emphasizes the balance between legislative urgency and due process, suggesting that while rapid responses may be necessary, they should not compromise parliamentary integrity. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Measures-used-to-quickly-pass-law-blocking-Income-Allianz-deal-used-sparingly-Indranee)\]

The article discusses the findings of a review panel investigating the mass disclosure of NRIC numbers on Singapore's Bizfile portal, revealing significant shortcomings by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) and the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI). 

Key legal aspects include the violation of internal data management rules and the Public Sector Governance Act (PSGA), specifically the IM8 instructions governing data collection and disclosure. The panel found no malicious intent but highlighted failures in communication and risk assessment that led to the incident. The report emphasizes the need for clearer policies and better data protection practices to prevent future occurrences.

In conclusion, the review underscores the importance of robust data governance and communication within public agencies to protect personal data effectively. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/NRIC-saga-Review-finds-key-Acra-MDDI-shortcomings-no-evidence-of-deliberate-wrongdoing)\]

The article discusses the ongoing appeal of John Soh and Quah Su-Ling, who were convicted of market manipulation related to the 2013 penny stock crash in Singapore. The Court of Appeal has dismissed three of five preliminary objections raised by their defense.

Key legal aspects include the court's rejection of claims regarding duplicity in charges, alleged bias from the presiding judge, and prejudicial joint trials. The defense emphasized the lack of particulars in the charges, arguing it hindered their ability to mount a defense. However, the prosecution countered that sufficient details were provided, and Quah had previously acknowledged understanding the charges.

In conclusion, while the appeal continues, the court's dismissal of key objections suggests a challenging path ahead for the defendants as they seek to overturn their convictions. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Judges-find-no-merit-in-3-of-5-preliminary-objections-raised-in-John-Soh-Quah-Su-Lings-appeals)\]
