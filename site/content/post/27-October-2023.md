## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


David Brian Chow Kwok-Hun, a Singaporean man, has been sentenced to seven years in jail for killing his pregnant wife and attempting suicide. Chow believed that his business was failing and that his suicide would bring shame to his wife. He stabbed her 15 times before attempting to take his own life. The court noted that the killing was not motivated by animosity or malice towards the victim. Chow pleaded guilty to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder with Anxious and Depressed mood, which impaired his reasoning and judgment. It was later discovered that the accounting staff had made an error in the financial report, and the business was not doing as badly as Chow had thought. The prosecution sought a sentence of nine to 12 years, while the defense asked for five to seven years, emphasizing the need for rehabilitation. The court ultimately decided on seven years' jail, considering Chow's motive and lack of malice. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/7-years-jail-for-man-who-killed-pregnant-wife-attempted-suicide-after-accounting-error-made-him-think-business-was-doomed)\]

In 2022, 800 students in Singapore, ranging from primary school to higher education, were prosecuted for vaping offenses. The Ministry of Education referred these students to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), and some were fined up to $2,000 per offense. The HSA is working with the Ministry of Health and the Health Promotion Board to address the issue through legislation, enforcement, education, and counseling. The article also highlights the dangers of vaping, including respiratory problems and nicotine dependence, especially among adolescents. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/800-students-including-primary-school-pupils-prosecuted-for-vaping-offences-in-2022)\]
