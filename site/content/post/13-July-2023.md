In Singapore's legal realm, winds of change blow,  
Platform workers gain power, unions to grow.  
Family violence tackled, with laws refined,  
Emotional abuse recognized, survivors find,  
A brighter path forward, justice to bestow.  
Today's blog explores legal shifts, let's go!

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore platform workers will soon have more bargaining power and representation through trade union-like bodies. The Ministry of Manpower has accepted recommendations for a new legislative framework to be implemented from the second half of 2024. This includes collective bargaining, dispute resolution, and benefits. Platform companies support the development. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Platform-workers-in-Singapore-to-get-more-bargaining-power-better-representation)\]

Singapore's Women's Charter (Family Violence and Other Matters) (Amendment) Bill updates the definition of family violence to include emotional or psychological abuse. It introduces clearer categories of abuse and acknowledges the pattern of coercive control. Public education and training are needed to support survivors of coercive control and address financial abuse. A trauma-informed approach is crucial in tackling family violence. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Recognising-emotional-abuse-in-family-violence-is-a-landmark-shift-Opinion)\]
