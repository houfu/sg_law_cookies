"In the market's dance, layoffs twirl, unseen,    
Scams rise like spectres in the digital scene.    
Insurance clauses, in fine print they lurk,    
Hidden pitfalls in the workman's work.    
In this world of swift change and rapid churn,    
Caution and vigilance at every turn."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Lazada, an e-commerce company, recently laid off an undisclosed number of employees in Singapore without informing the union. The Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) is now negotiating with Lazada for better benefits for the affected employees, with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) facilitating the talks. Lazada initially offered two weeks' salary for each year of service, but FDAWU is negotiating for additional benefits. MOM has reminded employers to act responsibly during cost-cutting measures and adhere to the Tripartite Advisory on Responsible Retrenchment. Unionized companies like Lazada are required to discuss with their unions how to safeguard the interests of affected employees. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Laid-off-Lazada-staff-offered-2-weeks-pay-for-each-year-of-service-union-negotiating-on-benefits)\]

The Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (Fidrec) in Singapore has seen a significant increase in claims filed against banks by scam victims seeking to recover their losses. From July 2022 to June 2023, Fidrec received 509 fraud-related claims, a 95% jump from the previous financial year. Most of the claimants benefited from Fidrec's mediation service, with 66% of them receiving goodwill settlement offers from banks. However, these offers are usually partial waivers of the victims' losses, and they should not be seen as a blank cheque to be careless with banking habits. The article highlights two scam cases and provides lessons on avoiding scams, such as not downloading apps from unofficial sources and being cautious with sharing personal information. 

In conclusion, the increase in claims filed against banks by scam victims in Singapore highlights the ongoing issue of scams and the need for individuals to remain vigilant and take preventive measures to protect themselves. While mediation services may help victims receive partial settlements, it is crucial to practice caution and follow prevention tips to avoid falling victim to scams in the first place. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Over-500-scam-victims-filed-claims-in-bid-to-recover-losses-from-banks)\]

This article discusses two cases from the annual report of the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (Fidrec) in Singapore, highlighting the importance of understanding the terms of insurance policies. In the first case, a man was denied insurance coverage for a leg fracture because he had previously undergone knee replacement surgery on that leg, which was excluded in his policy. The Fidrec adjudicator ruled in favor of the insurer, emphasizing the clarity of the exclusion clause. In the second case, a man's claim for treatment in Malaysia was rejected because he had exceeded the residency clause in his policy. The insurer offered a goodwill refund of premiums as a resolution. The article advises policyholders to carefully read and understand insurance policy terms, negotiate or appeal special terms, and keep contact information up to date. 

Takeaway: It is crucial for policyholders to thoroughly understand the terms of their insurance policies, including any exclusion clauses or special terms. Reading all notices and clarifying any changes is essential, and maintaining up-to-date contact information can help avoid missing crucial notifications. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Take-note-of-policy-terms-that-dont-cover-some-medical-conditions)\]
