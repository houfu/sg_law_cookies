In courts where legacies and laws entwine,<br>  
A dance of governance and mental health align.<br>  
Siblings clash over homes, a family's divide,<br>  
While innovation seeks freedom, yet rules abide.<br>  
Estate shadows loom, as assets shift and sway,<br>  
In this tapestry of justice, truths find their way.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the evolving landscape of mental health awareness in Singapore's workplaces, highlighting both progress and persistent stigma. 

Key legal aspects include the recent Workplace Fairness Bill, which prohibits discrimination based on mental health conditions, and the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Health aimed at guiding employers. Despite a decline in overt discrimination, anecdotal evidence reveals lingering biases that affect employee treatment and career progression. Legal experts emphasize the need for clear criteria to differentiate performance issues from discrimination, alongside robust documentation to support claims.

In conclusion, while legislative advancements signal progress, fostering a supportive workplace culture is crucial for effectively addressing mental health stigma. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Attitudes-have-improved-but-fear-of-mental-health-stigma-at-work-still-persists)\]

The article discusses the tension between corporate governance practices and the need for innovation in companies, particularly in Singapore's rapidly evolving digital economy. It questions whether existing governance structures, which prioritize shareholder protection, hinder companies' ability to innovate.

Key legal aspects include the traditional focus on safeguarding minority shareholder interests through stringent compliance and oversight, which may stifle entrepreneurial risk-taking. The article highlights the need for a balance between protecting shareholder rights and allowing flexibility for long-term value creation. It suggests that current governance frameworks may not adequately support innovative endeavors, as evidenced by the experiences shared during a panel discussion.

In conclusion, the article advocates for a reevaluation of corporate governance practices to foster innovation while maintaining necessary protections for minority shareholders. This shift could involve allowing companies more leeway to pursue long-term projects and consider alternative structures, such as separate subsidiaries for innovation. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Does-the-existing-approach-to-corporate-governance-help-or-hinder-innovation-Opinion)\]

This article discusses a legal dispute among three siblings over the sale of their late mother's HDB flat, highlighting the complexities of property transactions among co-owners. 

The court ruled against the siblings' attempt to force a sale, emphasizing that applications for court orders should not be used to bypass the conveyancing process. Key legal principles include the necessity of showing a breakdown in relationships among co-owners and the requirement for good-faith negotiations. The ruling reinforces that reasonable requests from buyers cannot be construed as unreasonable behavior, and courts favor amicable resolutions over litigation.

In conclusion, this case serves as a reminder for effective legacy planning and the importance of cooperative negotiation in property sales to avoid costly disputes. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Why-three-siblings-fought-over-the-sale-of-their-late-mothers-HDB-flat)\]

The article discusses the legal implications surrounding Peter Kwee's registration of properties in his daughter’s name, allegedly to evade estate duty. Kwee admitted in court that estate duty was a factor in his decision, raising questions about beneficial interest and ownership.

Key legal aspects include the requirement that Kwee must not retain any beneficial interest in the properties to avoid estate duty. Kwee's legal team argues he believed he could maintain ownership while avoiding duty, citing his familial role and control over assets. Conversely, opposing counsel asserts this arrangement was a strategy to shield assets from creditors during his daughter’s bankruptcy.

The case highlights precedents regarding beneficial interest and the legal ramifications of asset transfers intended to evade creditors or taxes. Justice Philip Jeyaretnam's forthcoming judgment will clarify these complex issues.

In conclusion, this case underscores the risks of asset structuring for estate planning and the scrutiny such arrangements may face in bankruptcy contexts. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Peter-Kwee-registered-properties-in-daughters-name-to-avoid-estate-duty-lawyers)\]
