"In the heart of law, where justice unfurls,  
Through the lens of truth, the news summary swirls.  
AI in courtrooms, a future unfurled,  
In Singapore's hands, a pearl of the world.

In the dance of law, the narrative twirls."

The Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly develop a new large language model, GPT-Legal, to enhance Singapore's legal sector. GPT-Legal is tailored to the Singapore legal context and can accurately summarize long court judgments. It aims to save lawyers time in legal research and is currently focused on summarizing judgments and exploring other functions like drafting contractual agreements. The development of GPT-Legal includes building evaluation and verification tools to ensure accuracy. Additionally, Singapore is committed to providing digital resources to SMEs through the Digital Enterprise Blueprint. 

Key legal aspects: 
- The development of GPT-Legal aims to enhance Singapore's legal sector through the use of generative artificial intelligence.
- GPT-Legal is tailored to the Singapore legal context and can accurately summarize long court judgments.
- The development process includes building evaluation and verification tools to ensure accuracy and accountability.

Implications: 
- GPT-Legal can potentially save lawyers time in legal research by quickly finding relevant past judgments.
- The use of generative AI in summarizing judgments is seen as the most appropriate use for the legal sector currently.
- Technology providers need to understand the needs of individual SME customers to help them digitalize smoothly.

Precedents:
