"In the heart of law, where justice twirls,  
Cord-blood bank's plight, in chaos unfurls.  
In Singapore's courts, charges whirl,  
While a maid's dream of law, like a flag unfurls.  
In this dance of life, as the world twirls,  
News summaries spin, as the day unfurls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


At least two groups of customers of Cordlife Group, a cord-blood bank in Singapore, are considering class-action lawsuits after more than 7,000 cord-blood units were found to be damaged or at risk. The customers are seeking compensation for their non-viable cord blood and have started gathering fellow customers through social media platforms. The affected cord-blood units were stored in tanks that were exposed to temperatures above acceptable limits. While a class-action suit may be logistically complex in Singapore, the affected customers are seeking legal advice and exploring their options for recourse. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Cordlife-customers-push-for-legal-action)\]
