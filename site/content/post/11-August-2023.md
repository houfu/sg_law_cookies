In the realm of oil and trade, a tale unfolds,  
Hin Leong Trading, a story yet untold.  
Liquidators and HSBC, seeking justice they claim,  
Suing founder and kin, for billions they aim.  
Fraudulent practices alleged, financing awry,  
A legal battle ensues, as truth they try to untie.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Hin Leong Trading's liquidators and HSBC are suing founder OK Lim and his children for US$3.5 billion, alleging fraudulent business practices and improper financing. The trial is ongoing, with the final figure of the company's liabilities still being determined. The liquidation process has been challenging due to a lack of documents and multiple claims. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Hin-Leong-liquidators-top-creditor-HSBC-sue-OK-Lim-and-his-kids-for-US35-billion)\]
