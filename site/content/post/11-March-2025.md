In the digital dance of justice and crime,    
Extradition treaties and Bitcoin's climb.    
Cannabis whispers in youthful ears,    
While Facebook fights scam-fueled fears.    
Laws weave through the global stage,    
Guarding truth in this modern age.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses Singapore's efforts to extradite Indonesian businessman Paulus Tannos, who faces corruption charges. This marks the first extradition request under the newly effective treaty between Singapore and Indonesia.

Key legal aspects include the extradition treaty's provisions for various offenses, including corruption and money laundering, and its retrospective application for crimes committed up to 18 years prior. Tannos intends to contest the extradition, which could extend the legal process to two years or more. The Extradition Act allows for waiving extradition proceedings, but Tannos's refusal to consent complicates matters. 

In conclusion, the case underscores the complexities of international extradition processes and the importance of adhering to treaty obligations while ensuring due process for the accused. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-working-with-Indonesia-on-extraditing-fugitive-businessman-Shanmugam)\]

The article discusses the arrest and charges against Singaporean Malone Lam and his co-accused, Jeandiel Serrano, for their involvement in a massive Bitcoin theft valued at over US$230 million. 

Key legal aspects include:
- **Charges**: Both individuals face conspiracy charges for stealing and laundering cryptocurrency, with potential sentences of up to 20 years in prison.
- **Methods of Theft**: The indictment outlines their use of sophisticated techniques like mixers and virtual private networks to obscure their identities.
- **Asset Recovery**: As of October, approximately US$70 million has been recovered, but over US$100 million remains unaccounted for, raising questions about asset tracing in cryptocurrency thefts.

In conclusion, this case underscores the complexities of prosecuting cryptocurrency-related crimes and the challenges in recovering stolen digital assets. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singaporean-charged-with-US230-million-Bitcoin-theft-blows-US500000-a-night-in-clubs-gives-designer-bags-to-models-influencers)\]

The article discusses the concerns raised by Singapore's Second Minister for Home Affairs, Josephine Teo, regarding the rising permissive attitudes towards cannabis among youth, attributed to widespread misinformation. 

Key legal aspects include:
- The significant economic impact of drug crime in Singapore, amounting to $1.2 billion in 2015, despite strict drug laws.
- Teo's assertion that misinformation leads to misconceptions about cannabis safety, emphasizing its addictive nature and severe health risks.
- The mention of international examples, particularly Thailand's struggles post-decriminalization, highlighting the challenges of reversing drug policy once softened.
- Statistics indicating a troubling trend in youth drug abuse, with a notable percentage of new abusers under 30.

In conclusion, the article underscores the importance of maintaining stringent drug policies in Singapore to combat misinformation and protect public health, particularly among vulnerable populations. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Permissive-attitudes-towards-cannabis-likely-due-to-pervasive-misinformation-Josephine-Teo)\]

The article discusses new identity verification requirements for Facebook advertisers in Singapore, aimed at combating the rise of scam advertisements. 

Following a reported 12% increase in scam ads, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) mandates that all Facebook advertisers verify their identities by submitting government-issued IDs by June 2025. This requirement stems from the Online Criminal Harms Act, which imposes fines of up to $1 million for non-compliance. While the verification pilot showed a 55% decrease in scams on Facebook Marketplace, MHA remains vigilant and may expand verification to more sellers if necessary.

In conclusion, the new verification measures reflect a proactive legal response to e-commerce scams, reinforcing accountability for online platforms and enhancing user protection. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Facebook-advertisers-must-verify-their-identities-by-end-June-following-rise-of-scam-ads)\]
