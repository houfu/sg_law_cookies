  "In Singapore's halls, where power resides,  
  A false claim falls, truth overrides.  
  In the dance of law, a balance is sought,  
  Investments pour, yet security is bought.  
  In the world's grand play, these tales we twine,  
  In the break of day, through the news, we divine."

"In Singapore's halls, where power resides,  
A false claim falls, truth overrides.  
In the dance of law, a balance is sought,  
Investments pour, yet security is bought.  
In the world's grand play, these tales we twine,  
In the break of day, through the news, we divine."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Singapore government's proposed Significant Investments Review Bill (SIRB) is unlikely to negatively impact Singapore's foreign investment outlook in 2024. The SIRB takes a targeted approach, with a specific list of designated entities subject to ownership and control requirements, leaving the majority of the market open to foreign investment. The law applies to both local and foreign investors and is meant to protect essential entities. The main uncertainty lies in the list of designated entities, which could include critical infrastructure, sensitive technology, public opinion influencers, and strategic sectors such as finance and defense. Overall, the SIRB aims to provide clarity and assurance to investors while balancing national security interests. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapores-investment-outlook-in-2024-unlikely-to-be-hurt-by-Significant-Investments-Review-Bill)\]
