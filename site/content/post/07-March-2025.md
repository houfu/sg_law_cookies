In courts where truth and tales entwine,<br>  
Ministers guard their names, reputations on the line.<br>  
Tech exports tangled in a web of deceit,<br>  
While real estate dreams face deadlines they must meet.<br>  
Public trust and media's dance, a delicate sway,<br>  
In Singapore's evolving legal ballet.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses a proposed legal framework in Singapore allowing victims of online harms to sue tech platforms and perpetrators for compensation, following substantial public support in a recent consultation.

Key legal aspects include the potential for victims to seek redress in local courts for various online harms, such as harassment and deepfakes. The proposal emphasizes the duty of platforms to act on reported harms, risking liability for damages if they fail to respond appropriately. However, concerns were raised regarding the blurring of responsibilities between content creators and platforms, potential for frivolous lawsuits, and the impact on free speech.

The proposal also includes establishing a government agency to assist victims, akin to Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, which would streamline reporting processes and enhance accountability. Additionally, the idea of enabling victims to access user information of perpetrators was supported, though it raises privacy concerns.

In conclusion, the proposed measures aim to empower victims and enhance platform accountability, yet they must navigate complex legal and ethical challenges to ensure effective implementation. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Proposal-to-let-victims-of-online-harms-take-tech-platforms-to-court-gets-public-support)\]

**Summary of Legal Developments in Nvidia Chip Case**

New charges have been filed against three men in Singapore linked to the fraudulent export of servers potentially containing Nvidia chips. Aaron Woon Guo Jie and Alan Wei Zhaolun face multiple fraud charges for misrepresenting the end users of servers from Supermicro and Dell. A third individual, Li Ming, is charged under the Computer Misuse Act for unauthorized access to a bank account. The case raises significant issues regarding export controls imposed by the US on AI chips, with implications for compliance and enforcement in international trade.

In conclusion, this case underscores the importance of transparency in export transactions and adherence to international laws, particularly concerning sensitive technology. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-charges-for-3-men-allegedly-linked-to-servers-that-likely-contained-Nvidia-chips)\]

The article discusses the accountability of ministers overseeing agencies involved in the NRIC saga in Singapore, emphasizing the importance of responsibility and trust in public service.

Key legal aspects include the findings of a review panel that identified lapses in communication and process between the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) and the Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI). Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean stated that ministers must bear overall responsibility, regardless of direct involvement, highlighting a precedent for political accountability in public service. The incident raises implications for public sector data governance and the enforcement of internal codes like IM8, which governs data disclosure.

In conclusion, this incident underscores the necessity for clear communication and oversight in public agencies to maintain public trust and prevent future lapses. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Ministers-overseeing-agencies-involved-in-NRIC-saga-have-to-bear-overall-responsibility-SM-Teo)\]

The recent defamation suits filed by Singaporean Ministers K. Shanmugam and Tan See Leng against Bloomberg and journalist Low De Wei highlight critical issues surrounding media reporting and reputational harm. The ministers claim that an article published in December 2024 falsely implied they engaged in non-transparent property transactions, potentially suggesting money laundering.

Key legal aspects include the ministers’ assertion that the article disparaged their reputations and roles, while Bloomberg contends that its reporting was factual and not defamatory. The case raises questions about the balance between freedom of the press and protection against defamation, particularly regarding public figures.

The implications of this case could set precedents for how media outlets report on public officials and the legal thresholds for defamation claims in Singapore. The ministers seek unspecified damages and an injunction against further dissemination of the alleged defamatory statements.

In conclusion, this case underscores the ongoing tension between media accountability and the rights of public officials, with significant potential ramifications for both journalism and defamation law in Singapore. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Ministers-Shanmugam-Tan-See-Leng-say-parts-of-Bloomberg-article-calculated-to-disparage-them)\]

The article discusses the recent extension of the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) remission deadline for large, complex development projects in Singapore, a move welcomed by developers but calling for further adjustments.

The key legal aspects include the extension of the ABSD remission timeline by six months to one year for projects that meet specific criteria, such as complex technical requirements or integration with public transport. Developers are currently liable for a 40% ABSD on land purchases, with a potential remission of 35% if all units are sold within five years. The Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore (Redas) advocates for a waiver for projects with 95% unit sales, arguing that the remaining units are often larger and harder to sell due to high ABSD rates on foreign buyers.

This policy revision reflects a broader trend to accommodate the unique challenges faced by larger developments, though some industry experts argue for even longer extensions. The implications suggest a potential boost in developer confidence, but caution remains due to high redevelopment costs and market conditions.

In conclusion, while the extended ABSD remission deadline is a positive step for developers, further refinements may be necessary to fully address the complexities of large-scale projects in Singapore's evolving real estate landscape. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Extended-ABSD-remission-deadline-for-big-complex-projects-timely-developers-want-more-fine-tuning)\]
