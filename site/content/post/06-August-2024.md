  "In the court's stern gaze, truth's harsh light unfurls,  
  Cryptic deals in shadows, deceit in digital swirls.  
  A son's dark deeds, a mother's plight unfurled,  
  In the city's heart, where justice whirls.  
  In this world of ours, where chaos twirls,  
  Stand the silent sentinels, as each story unfurls."

"In the court's stern gaze, truth's harsh light unfurls,  
Cryptic deals in shadows, deceit in digital swirls.  
A son's dark deeds, a mother's plight unfurled,  
In the city's heart, where justice whirls.  
In this world of ours, where chaos twirls,  
Stand the silent sentinels, as each story unfurls."

The High Court in Singapore has dismissed a $12 million lawsuit brought by a Greek investor against fintech firm Snap Innovations and businessman Bernard Ong, founder of failed crypto firm Torque. The court ruled that the investor failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the authenticity of a service agreement that allegedly committed Snap to replacing stolen digital assets. The court also found that Ong did not have the authority to bind Snap to such an agreement. The judgment noted that the document was likely forged, rendering it inadmissible as evidence. This case highlights the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments and the importance of due diligence by investors. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Court-dismisses-investors-12m-claim-against-Snap-Innovations-and-founder-of-crypto-platform-Torque)\]

A 61-year-old man in Singapore has been sentenced to 14 years' preventive detention for attempting to sexually assault his 81-year-old mother. The court determined that preventive detention was warranted as the man had a history of recurring domestic violence and contempt for law enforcement. The man pleaded guilty to three charges, including attempted sexual assault, causing grievous hurt to his wife, and using criminal force on a police officer. The judge noted the man's past convictions and described him as a "menace to society." Despite his children's letters speaking of his qualities as a father, the judge emphasized the need for an appropriate sentence.
