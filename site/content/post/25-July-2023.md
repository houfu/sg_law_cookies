In Singapore's legal realm, where justice thrives,  
Laws are changing to protect women's lives.  
Overtime battles fought, workers' rights upheld,  
In courtrooms, the stories of justice are spelled.  
From violence to employment, laws pave the way,  
Today's blog post brings legal news in poetic display.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore's Home Affairs and Law Minister, K. Shanmugam, stressed the importance of good laws and societal efforts to empower women. Legislative changes have been made to protect victims of violence and strengthen protection for victims of family violence. The conference emphasized the need for livelihood opportunities, affordable housing, and awareness of new laws. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Beyond-good-laws-societys-efforts-needed-to-further-womens-development-Shanmugam)\]

Singapore's High Court ruled that employers must pay workers for overtime, even if it exceeds the 72-hour monthly cap. The ruling emphasizes the purpose of the cap is to protect employees, not deny them overtime pay. Employers cannot use the cap as an excuse to avoid payment. The ruling applies to all workers with overtime entitlements, highlighting the importance of employment law in safeguarding workers' rights. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Employers-cannot-tell-workers-to-do-overtime-and-yet-not-pay-them)\]
