In courts where justice finds its voice,    
Spousal rights and AI's choice,    
Scams and sanctions, a global dance,    
Protection sought in cyber's expanse.    
A world in flux, laws redefine,    
In shadows cast, new paths align.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the forthcoming guidelines from Singapore's Ministry of Law (MinLaw) aimed at assisting legal professionals in the responsible use of generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) amid privacy and ethical concerns.

Key legal aspects include the recognition of potential inaccuracies and privacy risks associated with gen AI, such as the storage of user information and search history. Minister Murali Pillai emphasized the need for ethical frameworks to govern AI development. The ministry is consulting stakeholders to ensure these guidelines address security and ethical considerations effectively.

The implications for legal practice are significant, as the adoption of gen AI could enhance efficiency, allowing lawyers to focus on higher-value tasks. The pilot initiative for legaltech consultants aims to support law firms in integrating these technologies.

In conclusion, the guidelines represent a proactive approach to harnessing AI's potential while safeguarding ethical standards and user privacy in the legal sector. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Guidelines-for-lawyers-using-AI-in-works-amid-concerns-over-user-info-search-history-being-stored)\]

This article discusses a significant legal case in Singapore involving a man sentenced to over 14 years in prison and caning for raping his wife, marking a pivotal moment following the repeal of spousal immunity.

The man, who initially claimed the sexual acts were consensual, changed his plea to guilty after the victim testified. His conviction is notable as he is believed to be the first individual prosecuted for spousal rape since the repeal of immunity in January 2020. The High Court considered aggravating factors such as the threat of violence and the emotional impact on the victim, leading to a sentence of 14 years and 12 strokes of the cane.

This case underscores the legal shift in Singapore regarding spousal rape and highlights the judiciary's stance on domestic violence, emphasizing accountability for perpetrators regardless of marital status.

In conclusion, this case represents a landmark ruling in the fight against domestic violence, reinforcing the legal principle that consent must be present in all sexual encounters, even within marriage. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-than-14-years-jail-caning-for-man-who-raped-wife)\]

The article discusses Singapore's consideration of caning as a punishment for certain scam-related offences, prompted by record-high scam losses in 2024. Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling indicated that the government is evaluating this punitive measure in response to the severe impact of scams on victims.

Key legal aspects include the proposed alignment of penalties for scammers with those for moneylenders, where caning is already applicable. The article highlights the Sentencing Advisory Panel's recommendation for stricter penalties for money mules, advocating for a minimum jail term. Additionally, new laws targeting SIM card abuse and enhanced cooperation with online platforms like Telegram are discussed, indicating a comprehensive approach to combatting scams.

In conclusion, the potential introduction of caning for scam offences underscores Singapore's commitment to deterring serious financial crimes, reflecting a shift towards harsher penalties in response to escalating scam activities. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-considering-caning-as-punishment-for-some-scam-offences)\]

Key legal aspects include the increase in protection order applications to the Protection from Harassment Court, with a notable rise from 346 in 2021 to 631 in 2024. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) plans to establish a new agency to address online harassment, allowing victims to report incidents and seek recourse. This agency will clarify existing laws regarding online harms and enhance accountability for anonymous perpetrators. 

The takeaway is that Singapore is actively enhancing legal frameworks to protect individuals from online abuse, reflecting a growing recognition of the need for legal recourse in the digital age. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-protection-orders-filed-most-cases-involved-cyber-bullying-doxing-MinLaw)\]

The sanctions encompass economic measures, individual sanctions, and restrictions on the export of specific goods, including advanced electronics. Splendent Technologies is the second Singaporean firm sanctioned, following Deflog Technologies in 2023.
