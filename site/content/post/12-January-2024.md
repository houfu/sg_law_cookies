  "Across the digital sea, codes safeguard our trade,  
  In lands of old, a passport-free parade.  
  K-pop beats echo in legal halls,  
  Where Monster's claim to fame befalls.  
  In the dance of news, truth's ballet twirled,  
  A poetic glimpse into the world."

Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

"Across the digital sea, codes safeguard our trade,  
In lands of old, a passport-free parade.  
K-pop beats echo in legal halls,  
Where Monster's claim to fame befalls.  
In the dance of news, truth's ballet twirled,  
A poetic glimpse into the world."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore has published a recommended standard for mobile apps, particularly those that perform high-risk transactions like banking and e-commerce. Developers are encouraged to adopt the standard to protect their apps from malware and phishing attacks, but experts warn that the costs for companies to meet the standard could be significant. The standard references requirements established by the Open Worldwide Application Security Project, but a study found that most apps do not meet these security requirements. While developers focus on enhancing the customer experience, security considerations may be sidelined. The implementation of the standard could be a strategic investment that prevents security incidents and financial losses in the long term. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Companies-likely-to-incur-significant-costs-to-meet-cyber-agencys-standard-for-mobile-app-safety)\]

Singapore and Malaysia are exploring the implementation of a passport-free QR code system to expedite immigration clearance for land travel between the two countries as part of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JSSEZ). Digitized processes for cargo clearance at land checkpoints are also being considered. The JSSEZ aims to enhance cross-border connectivity in goods and enable freer movement for professionals to support investments and business operations. The MOU signed between the two countries will pave the way for the development of a legally binding agreement in the future. Singapore is Johor's second-largest foreign investor, and the implementation of the JSSEZ is expected to further enhance economic growth and bilateral relations between the two nations.

K-pop group BabyMonster, managed by YG Entertainment, has won a trademark case in Singapore against Monster Energy Company (MEC). MEC attempted to prevent YG from registering the trademarks "BabyMonster" and "BabyMonsters" for the girl group. The court ruled in favor of YG, stating that the marks were dissimilar to MEC's trademarks. MEC, which owns 33 registered trademarks in Singapore, has a history of filing oppositions with the Registrar of Trade Marks. The decision highlights the importance of conducting thorough trademark searches and considering conceptual, visual, and aural similarities when assessing trademark disputes.

In conclusion, BabyMonster's victory in the trademark case against Monster Energy Company underscores the significance of carefully analyzing the similarities and dissimilarities between trademarks. This ruling serves as a reminder for companies to conduct comprehensive trademark searches and consider multiple factors when opposing trademark applications. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/K-pops-BabyMonster-win-trademark-case-in-Singapore-against-Monster-Energy-drink)\]
