In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From AI's risks to cremation woes untold,  
Chief Justice warns of AI's lacking grace,  
While families seek justice in wrongful cremation case,  
Acra reminds businesses to update their space,  
In this legal landscape, we find a diverse chase.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore's Chief Justice, Sundaresh Menon, urged lawyers to learn about AI's ethical risks and verify information from AI tools. He warned about AI's lack of values like honesty and integrity and emphasized the need to balance AI with legal expertise and emotional intelligence. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Lawyers-should-learn-AI-but-must-be-aware-of-its-ethical-risks-Chief-Justice-Menon)\]

Singapore's Acra reminds companies to update registered office address to receive important correspondence. Failure to comply can result in fines. Recent probe found companies linked to suspects not at registered addresses. Registering a company in Singapore is quick and affordable, but requires local director and office. Number of registered businesses in Singapore remains consistent. Dormant companies must declare status to Acra. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Billion-dollar-money-laundering-probe-Firms-must-ensure-registered-office-address-is-up-to-date)\]
