Singaporean Ministers Shanmugam and Balakrishnan are suing Lee Hsien Yang for defamation over his Facebook comments about the Ridout Road saga. They deny the allegations and demand an apology, withdrawal of claims, and damages. Lee suggests they sue him in a British court. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau found no wrongdoing. Lee and his wife are living overseas after being investigated for lying during judicial proceedings. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Ministers-Shanmugam-Vivian-Balakrishnan-sue-Lee-Hsien-Yang-for-defamation-over-Ridout-Road-claims)\]

Over 7,000 Duolingo users in Singapore have had their email addresses leaked after the data of almost 2.7 million users was put up on hacking forums.

Phishing has become increasingly common in Singapore, with 8,500 reported cases in 2022, more than double the number in 2021. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-than-7000-Singapore-Duolingo-users-e-mail-addresses-found-in-leaked-database)\]
