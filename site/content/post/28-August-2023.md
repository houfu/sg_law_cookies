In Singapore's legal realm, challenges arise,  
Tokenising real estate, a venture with surprise.  
AI in the workplace, legal concerns take flight,  
Guidelines needed to ensure everything is right.  
Lapel pins for new lawyers, a symbol of pride,  
Today's blog post, legal news simplified.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Tokenisation of real estate in Singapore presents legal challenges. Investors' rights depend on issuer terms, token type, and property jurisdiction. Registering ownership is difficult due to requirements. Platforms seek alternative solutions. Tokenisation is a new avenue with risks. Overseas property ownership subject to foreign laws. Token investment limited to institutional and accredited investors. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Legal-hurdles-surrounding-real-estate-token-investors-in-Singapore)\]

The use of AI in the workplace raises legal issues. Responsibility for AI decisions, data privacy in surveillance, and intellectual property rights are key concerns. Guidelines and regulations are needed to address these issues. The EU has formulated the first comprehensive legal framework for AI, and other jurisdictions are likely to follow suit. Organizations must be prepared for future regulation in this area. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/By-all-means-use-AI-at-work-but-be-mindful-of-the-thorny-legal-issues-that-can-arise)\]

SAL has issued lapel pins to new lawyers called to the Singapore Bar. The pins bear SAL's motto and a unique admission number, to be worn during court duties. Over 430 new lawyers received the pins, and all lawyers will receive them by year-end. The pins symbolize professional standards.
