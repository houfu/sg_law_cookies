Singapore's IMDA has implemented a code of practice for social media platforms to enhance online safety. Platforms must inform users of actions taken on their reports and prevent harmful ads targeting young users. Non-compliance may result in fines or service blocking. The code includes content moderation guidelines, user safety tools, and reporting mechanisms. Minister Josephine Teo emphasizes reporting harmful content. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Tighter-control-of-ads-on-younger-teens-social-media-accounts-IMDA)\]
