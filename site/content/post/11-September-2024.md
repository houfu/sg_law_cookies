## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore has enacted a transformative Bill that officially recognizes ride-hail and delivery gig workers as a distinct legal class, effective January 1, 2025. This legislation grants these "platform workers" enhanced labor protections, including increased contributions to the Central Provident Fund and mandatory work injury insurance. Notably, they can form legally recognized associations to negotiate collective agreements. While the Bill aims to balance stakeholder interests, it raises concerns about implementation costs and the dynamic nature of platform algorithms. The law may pave the way for broader protections in other gig sectors, highlighting Singaporeâ€™s leadership in labor regulation for gig economies. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-passes-landmark-Bill-recognising-ride-hail-delivery-gig-workers-as-distinct-labour-class)\]

The article discusses the recent amendments to Singapore's Casino Control Act, which introduce stricter regulations for gamblers and casino operators at Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa. Key changes include criminalizing the withdrawal of bets after results are announced, enforcing family visit limits, and expanding the definition of illegal recording to include non-card games. Violating these new provisions could lead to jail time or hefty fines. Additionally, minors face increased penalties for falsifying age, and casinos can now share patron information to combat money laundering. These amendments aim to address evolving challenges in the gambling industry.

In conclusion, the updated laws signify a proactive approach to managing casino-related activities and enhancing regulatory measures in Singapore's gambling landscape. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-and-stricter-laws-for-MBS-RWS-casino-gamblers-and-operators)\]

The article discusses the Singapore Ministry of Education's (MOE) legal actions against contractors related to breaches involving the Mobile Guardian app, a device management tool used in schools. In August 2024, a cyber attack affected 13,000 devices, leading to data loss for some students. MOE has halted the app's use and plans to introduce a new application by January 2025. Legal implications include accountability for contractors and potential repercussions for data management practices. The incident underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in educational technology. Ultimately, the MOE aims to enhance digital learning while addressing security vulnerabilities. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Mobile-Guardian-breaches-MOE-takes-legal-action-against-contractors-new-app-expected-by-Jan-2025)\]

The article discusses Singapore's position in office-leasing activity among legal firms in the Asia-Pacific region during the first half of 2024, where it ranks fourth after Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong. Notably, legal firms in Singapore leased approximately 70,000 sq ft, representing 1.6% of the total tracked. The report highlights a trend among firms adapting their office designs and work styles to attract talent, amidst a challenging leasing environment in China influenced by geopolitical tensions and market downturns. In contrast, US cities dominated global leasing activity, with New York leading significantly. 

Takeaway: Singapore's legal market remains active, but firms must navigate a competitive regional landscape and evolving workplace needs. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-ranks-fourth-in-Apac-for-office-leasing-activity-by-legal-firms-in-H1-Savills)\]
