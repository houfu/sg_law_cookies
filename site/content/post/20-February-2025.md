In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
Fraud's shadow looms, yet truth's light displayed.    
Maritime paths with safety's beacon bright,    
Guiding ships through digital night.    
In legal tales of rise and fall,    
Redemption whispers through justice's call.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the High Court's decision to increase the prison sentences for Jason Sim Chon Ang, founder of a parquet company, and Tjioe Chi Minh, managing director of a timber supplier, for their roles in a fraudulent scheme involving banks.

The court imposed a 44-month sentence on Sim after the prosecution's appeal, finding he had orchestrated a fraud involving fictitious invoices to obtain $2 million in loans. Tjioe was sentenced to 30 months for aiding Sim, with the court rejecting his defense of ignorance regarding the fraudulent purpose of the documents. The ruling emphasizes deterrence in financial crimes and highlights the court's stance on maintaining integrity in Singapore's financial ecosystem.

In conclusion, this case underscores the legal consequences of corporate fraud and the judiciary's commitment to preventing financial misconduct. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Parquet-company-founder-gets-more-prison-time-for-cheating-banks-supplier-also-jailed)\]

**Summary of Legal Case Involving PropNex Unit and Alleged Misrepresentation**

The article discusses a lawsuit filed by businessman Melvin Li against PropNex Realty, its agent Ian Sng, and City Law, claiming S$1.2 million over alleged misrepresentation in a tax avoidance scheme known as "99-to-1." Li asserts that he was misled into believing that purchasing a 1% interest in properties owned by his parents was legal, which he later discovered breached the Stamp Duties Act, resulting in substantial additional tax liabilities.

Key legal aspects include the implications of negligent misrepresentation and the liability of real estate agents and law firms in advising clients on tax avoidance schemes. The case raises questions about the legality of "99-to-1" transactions and the responsibilities of licensed professionals in ensuring compliance with tax laws.

In conclusion, this case highlights the potential legal repercussions for professionals involved in advising on tax strategies, emphasizing the need for clear communication regarding the legality of such arrangements.

The article discusses the life and legacy of Glenn Knight, a prominent Singaporean prosecutor and former director of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), who recently passed away at age 80. 

Knight was renowned for his fearless prosecution of high-profile criminal and white-collar cases, including the infamous Pan-El saga, which resulted in significant financial repercussions for shareholders and led to the unprecedented closure of the Singapore stock market. His career, however, took a downturn when he was convicted of graft and misappropriation of CAD funds, resulting in a temporary ban from legal practice. Knight's eventual reinstatement in 2007 highlights the legal system's capacity for redemption.

In conclusion, Knight's life reflects the complexities of legal ethics and the potential for both triumph and downfall within the legal profession. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Former-star-prosecutor-and-CAD-director-Glenn-Knight-dies-at-age-80)\]
