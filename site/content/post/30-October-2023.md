Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In Singapore's legal realm we delve,  
Uncovering stories that truly compel.  
From money laundering schemes so vast,  
To CPF disputes that leave couples aghast.  
Drunk driving tragedies that claim a life,  
Our blog explores the legal strife.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Business Times has conducted an analysis of corporate filings and found that the suspects in Singapore's S$2.8 billion money laundering case have been incorporating companies in the country since January 2017. These individuals have ties to at least 35 entities in Singapore and Cambodia through various shareholdings and directorships. The article highlights the associations between the suspects through their corporate ties, with six of the companies connected to more than one suspect. The suspects' alleged involvement in the money laundering scandal has prompted authorities to investigate the business activities of the companies linked to them. The article also mentions that some of the entities linked to the suspects may be shell companies or companies set up to manage their investments. The article raises questions about the ease of exploiting Singapore's rules surrounding incorporation and suggests that tighter oversight of corporate secretaries and business services companies is needed. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapores-biggest-money-laundering-probe-reveals-web-of-corporate-links-some-more-than-6-years-old)\]

Divorcing couples in Singapore often argue over their Central Provident Fund (CPF) money. The CPF is seen as "illiquid" because cash cannot be freely withdrawn from CPF accounts if the account holder is under 55. Disputes arise when couples want a larger share of cash instead of each other's CPF savings. The confusion is exacerbated by the misconception that CPF transactions are like repaying a debt. In cases involving the sale of matrimonial homes, part of the proceeds must be refunded to the spouses' CPF accounts if CPF funds were used to purchase the property. Couples have two options for refunding CPF accounts: refunding the money first to CPF before dividing the leftover proceeds, or dividing the sale proceeds first and letting the spouses do the CPF refunds themselves. The High Court clarified that CPF money used for property purchases is an asset subject to division in divorce cases. The court has discretion on how to divide CPF assets, either before or after dividing the sale proceeds. It is important for couples to understand the CPF refund process, as CPF savings are protected from bankruptcy actions and can be used to buy a home once refunded. CPF contributions made during marriage will be shared in divorce cases, but the court has discretion in the division of assets. After divorce, it is crucial to change beneficiaries for CPF money, as a divorce does not automatically revoke previous nominations. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/When-couples-fight-over-their-CPF-money-during-divorce)\]

A woman in Singapore made wild claims during her divorce that her ex-husband had hidden over $160 million in offshore companies. She filed thousands of pages of documents to support her claims, but the judge ultimately dismissed them as baseless. The couple's total assets turned out to be just over $4 million, and the husband received $2.5 million while the wife received $1.8 million. The case highlighted the importance of lawyers assisting the court and providing clear and concise information. Both spouses in a divorce must disclose their assets fully and honestly, and those found to have hidden assets or lied can face adverse consequences. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Woman-made-wild-claims-that-ex-hubby-hid-over-160m)\]

A man in Singapore has been sentenced to seven years in jail for causing a fatal accident while driving drunk. Jeremiah Ng En You was driving his twin brother's car at speeds of up to 169km/h in a 60km/h zone when he crashed into several vehicles stopped at a red light, killing a Gojek driver and injuring six others. Ng pleaded guilty to drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving. The judge emphasized the devastating consequences of irresponsible driving and the need to send a clear signal to motorists who disregard the safety of others. Ng will also be disqualified from driving for 12 years after his release. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Jail-for-drink-driver-who-treated-road-like-Grand-Prix-driving-circuit-killing-1-and-injuring-6)\]
