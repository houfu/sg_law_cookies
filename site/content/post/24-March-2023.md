A former BP Singapore manager and a businessman had their jail terms raised for bribery. The manager used his position to benefit the businessman's company, causing some degree of detriment to BP. The offences undermined public confidence in the bunkering sector’s integrity. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Jail-terms-raised-for-ex-BP-manager-and-businessman-in-59m-corruption-case)\]

A former investigation officer in Singapore's Traffic Police's Fatal Accident Investigation Team has been sentenced to four years and two months in jail after pleading guilty to 12 forgery charges. Kenny Cheong Chyuan Lih forged 40 documents, including 15 investigation papers for traffic accidents, 14 of which involved fatalities. Cheong's forgeries caused no wrongful convictions, but eight coroner's inquiries had to be reopened. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Jail-for-cop-who-committed-forgery-in-investigation-papers-for-traffic-accidents)\]
