In the heart of Singapore, a network's silent cry,<br>  
Emergency lines lost, under a watchful sky.<br>  
Contracts clash in corporate halls, a S$34 million tale,<br>  
Arbitration's gavel strikes, justice prevails.<br>  
Climate whispers call for change, a nation's green plea,<br>  
Towards net-zero dreams, by twenty fifty-three.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


On October 8, Singapore experienced a significant disruption in Singtel's telecommunications network, affecting emergency hotlines and various public services for over three hours. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is investigating the incident, emphasizing the urgency of restoring key services. The disruptions raised concerns about public safety, as hotlines for emergency services were temporarily unreachable. Singtel has stated that this was not a cyber-related issue and is working to prevent future occurrences. The incident highlights the critical reliance on telecommunications for emergency response and public services, prompting discussions on contingency plans. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Emergency-business-hotlines-restored-after-hours-long-Singtel-landline-outage)\]

The article discusses Keppel Pegasus's successful arbitration against Cuscaden Peak Investments, resulting in a S$34 million award for breach of an implementation agreement. The tribunal found in favor of Keppel, which sought enforcement of its rights after SPH, the previous name of Cuscaden, terminated their agreement. The interest on the amount awarded is set at 5.33% per annum starting from April 29, 2022. Notably, this award is not expected to significantly impact Keppelâ€™s financial metrics. The case underscores the importance of contractual obligations and the potential for arbitration to resolve disputes in corporate takeovers. 

In conclusion, this arbitration highlights the enforceability of implementation agreements and the implications for parties involved in competitive bidding situations. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Keppel-unit-awarded-S34-million-for-2022-arbitration-case-against-Cuscaden-Peak)\]

Singapore is seeking public feedback on its new national climate targets for 2035 as part of its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050. The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) aims to gather insights on key measures, including carbon taxes and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Under the Paris Agreement, targets must reflect "highest possible ambition" every five years, with Singapore's upcoming submission due in February 2025. Experts suggest a potential 2035 target of 45 million tonnes CO2, but emphasize the need to balance domestic emissions reductions with international carbon credits. The public consultation runs until November 5, 2023. 

In conclusion, Singapore's proactive approach in soliciting public input signals its commitment to a transparent and ambitious climate strategy. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-sets-new-national-climate-target-for-2035-Govt-invites-public-feedback)\]
