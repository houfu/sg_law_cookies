  "Charges fly in courts, where truth's flag unfurls,  
  In the dance of justice, the legal world whirls.  
  From Singapore's shores, to Australia's pearl,  
  In the heart of law, narratives twirl.  
  In the shadow of deceit, a tale of money swirls,  
  In the light of truth, a new day unfurls."

"Charges fly in courts, where truth's flag unfurls,  
In the dance of justice, the legal world whirls.  
From Singapore's shores, to Australia's pearl,  
In the heart of law, narratives twirl.  
In the shadow of deceit, a tale of money swirls,  
In the light of truth, a new day unfurls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Former transport minister S. Iswaran has been granted permission to leave Singapore to settle his son into university in Australia, despite facing 27 charges to which he pleaded not guilty. The prosecution imposed several conditions on his travel, including a cash bail of $500,000 and surrendering his travel documents upon return. Iswaran's case will also be transferred to the High Court due to the strong public interest in the matter. The defense has requested an early trial to expedite the resolution of the case. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Iswaran-allowed-to-leave-Spore-to-help-son-settle-in-at-Australia-uni-case-transferred-to-High-Court)\]

The Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has announced that compensation payouts for workplace-related injuries will increase by approximately 19% in November 2025. The maximum compensation for a workplace death will rise from $225,000 to $269,000, while the maximum compensation for total permanent incapacity will increase from $289,000 to $346,000. The changes are being made to keep pace with wage growth and rising healthcare costs. The Work Injury Compensation Act (Wica) allows employees to make claims for work-related injuries or diseases without having to file a civil suit under common law. The increase in compensation limits aims to protect employers from large payouts. In 2023, there were 36 workplace deaths, a decrease from the 46 recorded in 2022. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Maximum-compensation-for-workplace-related-injuries-to-increase-by-about-19-per-cent-in-2025)\]
