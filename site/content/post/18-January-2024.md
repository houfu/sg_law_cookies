  "In the court's stern gaze, corruption unfurls,  
  In the shadow of deceit, a data thief twirls.  
  Through the lens of law, truth's flag unfurls,  
  In the dance of justice, the world gently twirls."

Singapore's Communications and Information Minister, Josephine Teo, highlighted the need for laws to regulate deepfakes during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum. Teo stated that deepfakes, which involve AI tools creating fraudulent images of others, are an assault on the infrastructure of fact and pose a challenge to all societies. She suggested a risk-based approach to regulation, with heavy laws for extreme cases like deepfakes and lighter frameworks for innovation. Teo emphasized the necessity of having laws in place to address deepfakes, although the specific form they will take is yet to be determined. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Laws-needed-to-rein-in-deepfakes-says-Josephine-Teo)\]

In this case, a man who was sentenced to 29 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane for inviting men to rape his wife as he watched has had his appeal for a lighter punishment rejected by the court. The Chief Justice referred to the original sentence as "lenient" and emphasized the need for the court to adhere to sentencing principles and precedents. The case involved a group of husbands who conspired to drug and rape their own partners, and most of them were sentenced to between 13 1/2 and 22 years in prison. The crimes were discovered after one of the wives found explicit images of herself on her husband's phone.

The case involved a group of husbands who conspired to drug and rape their own partners, resulting in substantial prison sentences for most of the defendants.

A mobile phone dealer in Singapore has been fined a record $48,000 for misusing customers' personal data to register and sell SIM cards without their consent. The dealer, Koh Wei Ming, illegally sold over 1,000 SIM cards to anonymous buyers over four years, making a profit of around $35,000. The Personal Data Protection Commission received numerous complaints about customers receiving marketing messages despite being registered on the Do Not Call Registry, which led them to trace the messages back to the SIM cards sold by Koh. The commission found that Koh exploited the SIM card registration process by registering additional cards without customers' knowledge and selling them to unauthorized buyers. Koh's actions were intentional, caused inconvenience to innocent parties, and were difficult to detect. The commission emphasized the need for a severe penalty to deter similar breaches in the future. This case highlights the importance of protecting personal data and the potential consequences of misusing it. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Record-48k-fine-for-SIM-card-seller-who-misused-customer-data)\]
