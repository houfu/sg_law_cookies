  "Fraudulent sails in trade's turbulent seas,  
  Bribes whispering through the corporate trees.  
  Scams cast shadows, justice seeks light,  
  In the court's stern gaze, wrongs set right.  
  In this world's theatre, where truth unfurls,  
  Echoes the news, as the summary whirls."

"Fraudulent sails in trade's turbulent seas,  
Bribes whispering through the corporate trees.  
Scams cast shadows, justice seeks light,  
In the court's stern gaze, wrongs set right.  
In this world's theatre, where truth unfurls,  
Echoes the news, as the summary whirls."

The Court of Appeal in Singapore has upheld the dismissal of Winson Oil Trading's claim against OCBC and Standard Chartered (StanChart) in a payment dispute over two letters of credit (LCs) related to transactions with collapsed oil trader Hin Leong Trading. The court cited the "fraud exception" as the basis for the dismissal, as Winson had prepared letters of indemnity based on forged bills of lading (BLs), knowingly or without belief in their truth. The court found that Winson ignored red flags, such as the lack of loading documents and Hin Leong's inability to produce original BLs. The case highlights the importance of due diligence in verifying documents and responding to suspicious signs in LC transactions.

Disbarred lawyer M. Ravi has been ordered to return $120,000 to his former law firm, K.K. Cheng Law, which was paid by clients for his legal services.
