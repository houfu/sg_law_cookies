  "In the heart of Singapore, where towers rise,  
  Laws tighten, as the city's wisdom lies.  
  In the dance of finance, shadows lurk,  
  Yet, vigilant eyes, in duty, work.  
  In this tale of power, money, and rights,  
  Unfolds a saga of legal fights."

Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

"In the heart of Singapore, where towers rise,  
Laws tighten, as the city's wisdom lies.  
In the dance of finance, shadows lurk,  
Yet, vigilant eyes, in duty, work.  
In this tale of power, money, and rights,  
Unfolds a saga of legal fights."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore is taking steps to tighten its security against illicit financial activities after a $2.8 billion money laundering case exposed vulnerabilities in the country's regulatory environment. The case highlighted the role of property developers in preventing money laundering and led to changes in legislation to address concerns related to money laundering, housing accessibility, investor demand, and fair business practices. Singapore has also implemented stricter client scrutiny protocols in banks and is developing a centralized digital platform to combat illicit financial activities. The country is also updating regulations for digital payment tokens and implementing measures to protect victims from scams. The government is taking steps to safeguard the banking sector, including increasing insurance coverage on bank deposits. Furthermore, Singapore has introduced a new investment screening regime to protect entities critical to national security interests. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Tightening-Singapores-security-against-illicit-financial-activities)\]

Xie Yong, the director of 980 companies in Singapore, has been sentenced to four weeks' jail and fined S$57,000 for neglecting his duty in relation to money laundering activities conducted through the companies he oversaw. Xie provided accounting and corporate services to foreign clients, primarily from China, who wanted to incorporate companies in Singapore. Despite requiring clients to sign indemnity agreements stating they would not engage in illegal activities, Xie did not take any steps to verify the legality of their operations. The case came to light after police reports were lodged in Singapore regarding a cheating scam involving transfers totaling over US$1.5 million. The sentencing highlights the importance of due diligence and monitoring for money laundering risks in corporate services providers.

Takeaway: Corporate service providers must exercise reasonable diligence in ensuring that the companies they incorporate and oversee do not engage in illegal activities, including money laundering. Simply obtaining indemnity agreements from clients may not be sufficient to discharge this duty. Providers should conduct thorough checks and monitor the activities of the companies they are associated with to mitigate the risk of money laundering. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Director-of-980-companies-jailed-fined-over-neglect-of-duty-on-money-laundering-discovery)\]

The Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) reached a resolution with Stamford Land, wherein the company's controlling shareholders will make a S$2 million donation to the SGX Investor Education Fund for violating the rule that directors and substantial shareholders should rank last in the allocation of rights shares. This is the first time SGX RegCo has settled a violation of its rules in this manner. However, SGX RegCo stated that companies can make their case if they have concerns about fully satisfying all applications for excess rights shares by minority shareholders. The regulator clarified that fulfilling applications for excess rights shares should not be a mechanism to gain control of a company or circumvent listing rules. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SGX-RegCos-resolution-with-Stamford-Land-spotlights-rules-on-allotment-of-rights-shares)\]
