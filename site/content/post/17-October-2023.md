In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
Cryptocurrency fraud and freezing orders take hold.  
Grab's acquisition sparks competition concerns,  
While a tragic fire leaves a nation yearning to learn.  
From NFTs to officer charges, the legal landscape we explore,  
In today's blog, legal tales galore.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Several cryptocurrency exchanges in Singapore are collaborating with London-based financial crime investigators in a case involving the theft of a crypto password and the fraudulent transfer of millions in cryptocurrencies. The fraudsters, who are purportedly from Singapore, are laundering the illicit assets through exchanges operating in the country. London-based Intelligent Sanctuary has tracked down the assets and obtained a worldwide freezing order in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) from the Singapore High Court. The NFT, created by NFT marketplace Mintable, is permanently attached to the hackers' private wallets and allows for immediate action when funds are moved. This innovative use of NFTs demonstrates their real and functional use case in law enforcement on the blockchain. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Crypto-exchanges-in-Singapore-roped-in-to-help-with-international-case-on-stolen-assets)\]

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has expressed concerns over Grab's proposed acquisition of Trans-cab. The CCCS believes that this acquisition could make it more difficult for Grab's competitors to expand or enter the market. Under the point-to-point transport regulatory framework, licensed ride-hailing operators are not allowed to impose exclusive arrangements that prevent their drivers from working for rival operators. However, the CCCS is concerned that the acquisition could affect Trans-cab drivers' usage of other platforms, giving Grab an advantage over its competitors. The CCCS will conduct a more in-depth review if the competition concerns are not addressed. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Competition-watchdog-raises-concerns-over-Grabs-proposed-Trans-cab-acquisition)\]

A Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officer has been charged for allegedly leaving a full-time national serviceman (NSF) alone to fight a fire in an HDB flat. The NSF, Sergeant 1 Edward H. Go, suffocated and died. The officer, Muhammad Kamil Mohamed Yasin, is charged with causing grievous hurt by a rash act. He is accused of leaving Sgt 1 Go alone in the burning unit without informing anyone. If convicted, the officer could face up to four years in jail, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. Another officer involved in the case is also under investigation. SCDF has redeployed him to a non-supervisory and non-operational post. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SCDF-officer-charged-over-death-of-NSF-who-was-allegedly-left-alone-to-fight-Henderson-Road-fire)\]
