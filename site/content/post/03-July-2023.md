In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From crypto regulations to properties sold,  
Couples facing ABSD troubles in divorce's wake,  
Marketers held liable for promises they break,  
Beware of unlicensed lawyers, the Law Society warns,  
These legal tales, a vivid tapestry adorned.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore's Monetary Authority is set to regulate the crypto sector by mid-2023. Licensed firms may face restrictions on lending and staking retail investors' digital assets. Audit requirements for retail customers' digital wallets are also expected. The regulations will need parliamentary approval before becoming law. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapores-upcoming-rules-on-crypto-sector-may-hit-some-providers-hard-Sources)\]

Couples in Singapore who hold properties separately to avoid ABSD may face problems during divorce. In a recent case, a husband was unable to prove his contributions to a property held in his wife's name. Couples in similar situations need solid documentation to prove their contributions for property claims. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Decoupling-to-avoid-ABSD-Couples-who-hold-properties-separately-can-face-problems-during-divorce)\]

The Law Society of Singapore warns against engaging S K Kumar Law Practice due to lack of valid licence and certified lawyers. Clients already engaged should seek assistance from other firms. Fugitive lawyer Charles Yeo has a warrant for pending charges. Firm's namesake, S.K. Kumar, was disbarred in 2017. Another lawyer, Dhanwant Singh, fined in 2019 for breaching rules. The Straits Times contacted the firm for comment. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Law-Society-says-public-should-not-engage-services-of-S-K-Kumar-Law-Practice)\]
