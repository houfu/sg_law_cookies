  "In the courtrooms, where truth and justice twirl, <br>  
  Echoes of deceit, in hushed whispers unfurl. <br>  
  Through the corridors of power, where secrets curl, <br>  
  In the heart of the city, a tale of woe unfurls. <br>  
  In the dance of life, where fate and destiny whirl, <br>  
  In the news of the day, the world's story unfurls."

Despite previous efforts to strengthen animal welfare laws and penalties, instances of abuse and abandonment continue to occur, involving both pet owners and professionals in the pet industry.

A veteran criminal defense lawyer in Singapore, Gregory John Fong Mun Yung, has been sentenced to two months in jail for committing a hit-and-run on the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE). Fong crashed into a motorcyclist while driving on the expressway and then left the scene. The prosecution sought a jail term of two to three months for Fong's offenses, highlighting that the victim suffered "grievous hurt." Fong's defense argued that he crashed into the motorcycle because a taxi encroached into his path and that he was lightheaded due to diabetes. The judge agreed with the prosecution and deemed a fine to be inappropriate, considering the impact on the motorcyclist and Fong's alleged erratic driving. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/2-months-jail-for-veteran-lawyer-who-crashed-into-motorcyclist-while-driving-on-KPE-then-left-scene)\]
