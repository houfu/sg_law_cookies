In Singapore's shifting tides, truth and law entwine,<br>  
From ride-hailing fees to property lines.<br>  
Bankruptcy shadows cast a somber hue,<br>  
While corporate governance seeks the light anew.<br>  
In whispers of data, falsehoods meet their fate,<br>  
A world in flux, where justice calibrates.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the ongoing concerns regarding the use of National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) numbers in Singapore, particularly in light of recent developments related to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Legal experts emphasize the importance of masking NRIC numbers and adhering to identity verification standards until new PDPA guidelines are issued.

Key legal aspects include the PDPC's current stance that the NRIC number is no longer considered protected data, yet businesses must continue to mask these numbers. Experts warn against using NRIC numbers for passwords and advocate for multi-factor authentication methods. The recent exposure of NRIC numbers via the ACRA's BizFile portal raises alarms about data privacy and identity theft risks.

In conclusion, businesses should exercise caution and enhance their identity verification processes to mitigate potential risks associated with the handling of NRIC numbers. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Experts-Businesses-should-continue-to-mask-NRIC-numbers-before-new-PDPA-Guidelines-are-issued)\]

The article discusses the unprecedented dismissal of three senior executives at Singapore Post (SingPost) following a whistle-blower report related to e-commerce shipment data falsification. This incident raises significant corporate governance concerns and shareholder inquiries.

Key legal aspects include the board's response to the whistle-blower's allegations of gross negligence by the executives, highlighting the importance of transparency in corporate governance. Shareholders are demanding clarity on the investigation's timeline and findings, as well as the implications for ongoing business operations and potential regulatory risks. Notably, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is monitoring the situation, emphasizing the need for adherence to governance standards.

In conclusion, this case underscores the critical balance between corporate accountability and shareholder rights, with potential implications for future governance practices in Singapore's listed companies. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SingPosts-dismissal-of-three-senior-execs-unprecedented-shareholders-seek-more-details)\]

The article discusses the upcoming fee increases by ride-hailing operators Gojek and Tada, attributed to the new Platform Workers Act set to take effect in January 2025. 

Both companies will raise platform fees per trip to cover costs associated with enhanced labor protections for platform workers, including mandatory contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and work injury compensation insurance. Gojek's fees will increase from 60 cents to $1.50, while Tada's will rise to $1.25. The Act mandates incremental CPF contributions for younger workers and establishes insurance requirements, reflecting a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for gig economy operators.

In conclusion, these changes underscore the growing legal obligations for ride-hailing platforms to ensure worker protections and financial security, potentially influencing operational costs and pricing strategies in the sector. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Ride-hailing-operators-Gojek-and-Tada-to-raise-platform-fees-by-up-to-50-cents-per-trip-from-2025)\]

The article discusses the issuance of correction orders under Singapore's Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) against Bloomberg and three other media outlets for disseminating false information regarding good class bungalow (GCB) transactions.

Key legal aspects include the government's assertion that the original Bloomberg article undermined public confidence in Singapore's property transaction transparency and falsely claimed that no government records exist for GCB sales without caveats. The Ministry of Law clarified that all property ownership information is accessible through the Integrated Land Information Service, and strict disclosure requirements are in place for property transactions, especially involving foreign purchasers.

The implications of this case highlight the stringent regulatory environment surrounding property transactions in Singapore, emphasizing the government's proactive stance against misinformation. The article also notes potential libel actions from government ministers against Bloomberg for statements regarding their property dealings.

In conclusion, this case underscores the importance of accurate reporting in the real estate sector and the legal repercussions of disseminating false information under Pofma. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Bloomberg-issued-Pofma-order-over-article-on-good-class-bungalow-transactions-in-Spore)\]

The article discusses the alarming rise in bankruptcy applications in Singapore in 2024, highlighting the challenges faced by bankrupt individuals and the legal framework surrounding bankruptcy.

Key legal aspects include the amendments to bankruptcy laws in 2016, which established fixed discharge periods of three to seven years, aiming to balance debtor rehabilitation with creditor compensation. The article also addresses misconceptions about the restrictions on bankrupts, such as the ability of their children to open bank accounts. It emphasizes the stigma attached to bankruptcy, particularly in employment contexts, and the lack of support for bankrupts compared to ex-offenders.

In conclusion, the article calls for a reevaluation of how bankrupts are treated in society, advocating for dignity and opportunities for recovery, while urging an investigation into the root causes of the rising bankruptcy applications. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Look-into-rise-in-bankruptcy-applications-this-year-Forum)\]
