"In the realm where justice and commerce twirl,  
Fraudulent schemes and false claims unfurl.  
Banks and lawyers in the spotlight's glare,  
While deceitful ads pollute the air.  
In this world of chaos, truth's precious pearl,  
In our summaries, slowly it swirls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A tyre workshop owner in Singapore has sued Citibank for allegedly breaching his instructions regarding more than $1 million in cheques he handed to his relationship manager. The owner, Mr Yeo Choon Meng, claimed that he wanted the money placed in fixed deposits in his sole name, but it was instead deposited into a joint account accessible to his former wife. The bank contended that it followed Mr Yeo's instructions, including using the funds to buy investment products. Mr Yeo is seeking the remaining $1.05 million from the bank and unspecified damages for psychiatric harm. 

The key legal aspects of this case involve the alleged breach of instructions by Citibank, the issue of joint accounts and their access rights, and the responsibility of banks to follow customer instructions. The case may hinge on the evidence presented by both parties regarding the instructions given and the actions taken by the bank. Precedents related to breach of contract and fiduciary duty may be relevant in determining the bank's liability. The outcome of this case could have implications for banks' obligations in handling customer instructions and the duty of care owed to customers, particularly those who may be financially illiterate or vulnerable.

In conclusion, this case involves a dispute between a tyre workshop owner and Citibank over alleged breach of instructions regarding the handling of over $1 million. The legal aspects revolve around breach of contract, fiduciary duty, and the bank's obligation to follow customer instructions. The outcome of this case could have implications for banks' responsibilities in handling customer funds and the duty of care owed to customers. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Tyre-workshop-owner-sues-Citibank-alleging-breach-of-instructions-over-more-than-1m)\]

A man in Singapore has been sentenced to five years in jail for his involvement in a goods and services tax (GST) fraud scheme that cheated the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) out of over $2 million. The fraud, known as "missing trader fraud," exploited the GST system for illicit gain. The scheme involved a group of businesses forming a supply chain, with the original seller disappearing without paying the collected GST. The state suffers a loss when IRAS refunds the last seller, who had not paid the collected GST. This is the second prosecution in Singapore involving missing trader fraud. 

Takeaway: The case highlights the serious consequences of GST fraud and the impact it has on government revenue and public benefits. The sentencing serves as a deterrent to potential fraudsters and emphasizes the importance of maintaining the integrity of the GST system. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Five-years-jail-for-man-in-GST-fraud-scheme-that-cheated-Iras-of-over-2m)\]

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) is investigating filtration company Sterra over a misleading online advertisement that implied the tap water in Singapore is unfit for drinking. The ad, which circulated on Instagram and Facebook, showed water teeming with microorganisms, but a PhD student debunked the claims in a viral video. The CCCS has the power to apply for a court injunction to restrain a business from engaging in unfair practices. Sterra has taken down the ad, and the CCCS will monitor the situation and take appropriate action if necessary. The case highlights the importance of accurate advertising and the potential consequences for misleading claims. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Competition-watchdog-probing-company-over-misleading-ad-on-tap-water-quality-in-Singapore)\]
