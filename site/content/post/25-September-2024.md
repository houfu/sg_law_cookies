In courts where justice's gavel falls,

In Singapore's halls, lessons taught.

A recent survey by Singapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM) reveals an uptick in reported job discrimination based on age and nationality in 2023, despite overall discrimination rates declining. The forthcoming Workplace Fairness Legislation mandates employers to establish grievance-handling processes, aimed at protecting employees from retaliation when reporting discrimination. Notably, while the proportion of employees seeking help rose significantly, many still refrain due to fears of workplace repercussions. The report emphasizes the need for increased awareness and formal procedures to combat discrimination, particularly against older workers. This legislation underscores a push for fair employment practices in Singapore. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-job-seekers-cite-discrimination-over-age-and-nationality-in-2023-MOM-survey)\]
