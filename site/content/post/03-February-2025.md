In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
Cryptos and kickbacks, secrets laid.    
Fairness laws in workplaces bloom,

In legal webs, truth's thread laid bare.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A recent case in Singapore highlights the legal repercussions of contempt of court in the context of cryptocurrency theft. Ho Kai Xin, who embezzled $5.6 million worth of crypto from ByBit Fintech, received a six-week jail sentence for violating civil court orders prohibiting her from spending the stolen funds.

Key legal aspects include:
- Ho's breach of a High Court injunction led to her contempt charge, emphasizing the court's authority to enforce compliance with its orders.
- The case underscores the intersection of civil and criminal proceedings, as Ho faces both contempt charges and criminal charges for theft and money laundering.
- The High Court's ruling illustrates the distinct yet overlapping nature of civil contempt and criminal conduct, allowing for separate penalties.

In conclusion, this case serves as a critical reminder of the serious consequences of disregarding court orders, particularly in complex financial crimes involving cryptocurrency. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Woman-who-stole-56m-worth-of-crypto-gets-6-weeks-jail-for-disobeying-civil-court-order)\]

The article discusses Singaporean firms' proactive measures to train staff in handling workplace grievances in light of the recently passed Workplace Fairness Bill. This legislation prohibits employment decisions based on specific characteristics, including age, nationality, and disability.

Key legal aspects include the requirement for employers to establish grievance-handling processes and provide training for HR teams on sensitivity and bias recognition. The Bill's implementation will be crucial for effective workplace fairness, with a second Bill expected to address private employment claims in 2025. Concerns have been raised regarding the adequacy of protections for outsourced workers.

In conclusion, firms must adapt their policies and training to comply with the new legal framework, fostering a culture of psychological safety and fairness in the workplace. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Some-Spore-firms-take-steps-to-train-staff-to-handle-workplace-grievances-to-align-with-new-laws)\]

The article discusses Singapore's new Code of Practice for Online Safety aimed at protecting minors from harmful digital content by requiring app stores to implement age screening measures. 

Key legal aspects include the code's mandates for app distribution services like Apple and Google to enforce accurate age ratings and respond to user reports of inappropriate content. This initiative builds on existing regulations such as the Online Criminal Harms Act and addresses gaps in current safeguards, which are often inadequate for preventing underage access to harmful apps.

The implications are significant; the code not only sets a precedent for stricter controls on digital content but also aligns with global trends toward increased scrutiny of tech companies regarding user safety. 

In conclusion, while the code represents a proactive step in safeguarding children online, its effectiveness will depend on comprehensive implementation and active participation from users and caregivers. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Online-harms-Can-app-stores-be-effective-gatekeepers-Opinion)\]

The article discusses the response of Nee Soon GRC MPs to a significant kickback case involving estate cleaners, emphasizing the integrity of public officials and the importance of whistleblower protections.

Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam highlighted that the MPs acted promptly by reporting the kickback scheme to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) upon learning of it from a whistleblower. The case involved Derrick Ho, who collected substantial kickbacks from workers for work permit renewals, leading to his imprisonment. The article underscores the legal obligations of MPs to maintain transparency and integrity, as well as the protections afforded to workers during the investigation.

Shanmugam cautioned against politicizing the incident, asserting that the whistleblower system functioned effectively and that the punishment was appropriately targeted at the individual responsible, rather than the entire contractor.

In conclusion, the article reinforces the critical role of integrity in public service and the necessity of a robust whistleblower framework to uphold accountability in government operations. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Nee-Soon-GRC-MPs-informed-MOM-of-kickback-case-the-moment-they-found-out-Shanmugam)\]

This article discusses the financial pressures faced by parents in Singapore regarding the costs of raising children, specifically the inflated perception of monthly expenses and the implications for child maintenance in divorce cases.

Key legal aspects include the common belief that raising a child costs around $2,000 monthly, which can lead to financial strain. The article references legal benchmarks for child maintenance, indicating that substantial awards are typically reserved for higher-income earners. Notably, cases are cited where financial overextension for children's overseas education led to legal disputes over maintenance reductions, highlighting the judiciary's concern for parental financial stability.

In conclusion, parents are encouraged to balance their financial obligations to their children with their own retirement needs, emphasizing the importance of realistic budgeting and financial planning to avoid legal conflicts and ensure long-term stability. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Some-parents-think-it-costs-2k-a-month-to-raise-a-child)\]
