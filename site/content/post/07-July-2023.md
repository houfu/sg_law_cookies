## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A man is on trial for allegedly murdering his five-year-old daughter in 2017. A disturbing video played in court shows him physically assaulting the girl. The accused's wife testified that she tried to intervene but was scared of being beaten. The trial continues. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Girl-5-allegedly-confined-and-murdered-by-father-10-minute-video-of-past-assault-shown-in-court)\]

Singapore is considering mandatory climate-related disclosures for non-listed companies, potentially the first in Asia. Large non-listed entities may need to disclose from 2027, while all listed issuers from 2025. The proposal is open for public consultation until September 30. The aim is to drive change and support a net-zero economy. Temporary reliefs and external assurance are recommended. Government decision depends on public feedback. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Mandatory-climate-disclosures-proposed-for-large-non-listcos-from-FY2027-all-listcos-from-FY2025)\]
