"In the courts of power, where justice twirls,  
Through the lens of law, the world unfurls.  
From Singapore's stance to sports' fierce fight,  
To deceit's downfall in corporate night.  
In the dance of news, truth's flag unfurls,  
In six brief lines, the tale of the world."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


President Tharman Shanmugaratnam emphasized the value of multilateralism and upholding international law, which both Singapore and many European countries recognize and appreciate. During his visits to Italy, Finland, and Estonia, heads of state expressed their gratitude for Singapore's perspectives and adherence to the rule of law. These countries view engagement with Singapore as beneficial because it provides a diverse perspective on global issues and avoids aligning with any particular superpower. Despite shifting power dynamics in Europe, Singapore must maintain its engagement with the region. The article also highlights Estonia's successful start-up culture, which is built on cooperation and a global outlook. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Multilateralism-international-rule-of-law-valuable-to-both-Singapore-Europe-President-Tharman)\]

The Singapore Sepak Takraw Federation (Perses) has filed a civil suit against the International Sepak Takraw Federation (Istaf), Asian Sepak Takraw Federation (Astaf), and former president Abdul Halim Kader, seeking reinstatement of its memberships and damages. The dispute began when Istaf terminated Perses' membership in November 2023 due to alleged misconduct within Perses' leadership. This termination resulted in Perses losing its National Sports Association (NSA) status and barred Singapore's athletes from competing in international events. Perses is now seeking redress in court for the wrongful termination. The case conference is scheduled for July 17. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Spore-Sepak-Takraw-Federation-files-suit-against-global-Asian-bodies-over-wrongful-termination)\]

Yip Chuen Wai, a former sales director of Laiye, was sentenced to 10 weeks' jail for duping his employer into believing they had won a government tender and pocketing a commission of S$37,000. Yip used a forged email and letter to trick his company into thinking they had been awarded the tender. He then received the commission payment and used it to settle his debts. Yip pleaded guilty to committing forgery and his jail term was backdated to June 4, 2024. 

This case highlights the seriousness of forgery and the potential consequences for individuals who engage in fraudulent activities. It also serves as a reminder to companies to implement robust internal controls and verification processes to prevent such incidents. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Jail-for-ex-sales-director-who-duped-employer-into-thinking-it-had-won-NLB-tender-pocketed-S37k-commission)\]
