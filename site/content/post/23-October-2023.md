Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In Singapore's legal realm we delve,  
Where news and opinions do swell,  
From nominee directorships to online harms,  
And joint ownership's intricate charms,  
Far Ocean's guilty plea, a tale to tell,  
Today's blog post, a legal journey we shall propel.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) in Singapore is considering amendments to the Companies Act and Acra Act to limit the number of nominee directorships an individual can hold. This move is part of a review to strengthen Singapore's corporate regulatory environment and prevent the use of shell companies for money laundering. Experts have differing opinions on the matter, with some cautioning against a blanket measure that punishes all corporate service providers and others suggesting that a limit on nominee director appointments will raise the standards of directors in Singapore. Acra is expected to table the proposed amendments in 2024. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Money-laundering-case-Experts-weigh-in-on-moves-to-curb-directorship-in-companies)\]

This article discusses the need for faster access to redress for victims of online harms. It highlights the case of Eve, who was targeted by an unknown sender and suffered from spamming and public shaming. The current laws in Singapore focus on severe online harms, but do not address non-criminal actions like cyber bullying. Experts suggest the establishment of a dedicated watchdog, similar to Australia's eSafety, which has the power to order online platforms to provide user information for investigation and can fine non-compliant companies. The watchdog also handles public education and coordinates online safety efforts with other countries. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Call-to-let-victims-seek-quicker-redress-for-more-types-of-online-harms)\]

When buying property with another person, it's important to understand the ownership rules. In joint ownership, the right of survivorship means that if one owner dies, the other usually inherits the whole property. However, this doesn't necessarily mean equal ownership while both owners are alive, especially if they haven't made equal payments. The initial payments made towards the property, including progress payments and related costs, will be relevant in determining each owner's share in case of a dispute. Renovation costs may also be considered contributions towards the purchase price if they increase the property's value. On the other hand, household expenses like utilities and maintenance payments do not affect ownership shares. It's crucial to have proper documentation to clarify ownership and avoid costly legal battles. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/4-ownership-rules-that-all-property-investors-should-know)\]

Singapore food processing company, Far Ocean Sea Products, and its CEO, Jordan Quek Ruiming, have pleaded guilty to charges related to the expiry dates of 5,880kg of fish and meat products. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) investigated the case, which is the largest it has probed. Far Ocean Sea Products and Quek each pleaded guilty to 30 charges for violating licensing conditions and one charge for illegally using a room for food processing. They also admitted to obstructing officers during the investigation. The company supplies fish and meat products to commercial and non-commercial clients in Singapore and overseas. The sentencing is scheduled for 20 November.
