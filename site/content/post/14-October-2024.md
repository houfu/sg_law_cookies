In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
Truth and trust in letters frayed.    
A Porsche's gleam, a marriage's end,    
Assets shared, as laws defend.    
Gambling debts and union cries,    
In legal webs, life's stories lie.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Pritam Singh, the Leader of the Opposition in Singapore, is set to stand trial on October 14 for allegedly lying to a parliamentary committee, a first under Section 31(q) of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. The charges stem from testimony related to former MP Raeesah Khan's false claims about a sexual assault victim. Singh faces potential penalties including fines up to $7,000 and a prison term of three years for each charge. His attempt to transfer the case to the High Court was denied, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the factual inquiry. The trial will run for 16 days, concluding on November 13. 

In conclusion, this case highlights the stringent accountability measures for parliamentary conduct in Singapore, with significant implications for political integrity and the legal repercussions of misleading testimony. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/WP-chief-Pritam-Singhs-trial-over-alleged-lies-to-Parliament-to-start-on-Oct-14)\]

A recent court ruling in Singapore acquitted two men, Mr. Pay Teow Heng and Mr. Pek Lian Guan, of graft charges after finding the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau's (CPIB) statements unreliable. The prosecution failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the $350,000 loans given by Pay to Henry Foo were corruptly intended to benefit Tiong Seng Contractors in LTA contracts. District Judge Soh criticized the CPIB’s investigative methods, noting significant inaccuracies and a lack of impartiality. The acquittal means they cannot be retried for these offences. The Attorney-General's Chambers is reviewing the ruling for potential appeal. The case underscores the importance of reliable evidence in corruption prosecutions. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Pair-accused-of-graft-acquitted-after-judge-finds-CPIB-statements-inaccurate-and-unreliable)\]

The article discusses the compliance of Dyson's recent retrenchment notification with Singaporean labor laws, as confirmed by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Dyson submitted its notification within the legally required timeframe, despite criticism from the United Workers of Electronics and Electrical Industries (UWEEI) for providing only one day's notice to the union. MOM clarified that since the affected employees are professionals, managers, and executives (PMEs) not covered by the union, the notice period is negotiable. The law allows individual representation for PMEs regarding retrenchment benefits, ensuring protection for both employees and employers. The article emphasizes the importance of timely union notifications and the provisions for retrenchment benefits. 

In conclusion, while Dyson's actions were lawful, the situation underscores the complexities of union representation and retrenchment procedures in Singapore. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Dysons-notification-of-retrenchment-was-in-compliance-with-law-MOM)\]

A recent Singapore High Court ruling has clarified that lottery winnings during marriage are considered joint assets, reinforcing the principle of shared marital income. In a case involving a couple who won a Porsche, the court determined that the proceeds from the car sale, around $83,000, should be divided equally despite the wife being the actual winner. The ruling emphasizes that financial windfalls accrue to both spouses, unlike premarital assets. Furthermore, the case highlights the importance of transparency in financial dealings, as discrepancies in bank records affected asset division. The overall takeaway stresses the significance of managing expenses to ensure long-term financial stability. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Struck-a-lottery-while-married-Prize-deemed-part-of-marital-assets)\]

In a recent Singapore case, a divorcing woman sought to prevent her husband from selling their condominium to pay off $480,000 in gambling debts. The High Court ruled against her request, emphasizing that she failed to demonstrate how the sale would unfairly prejudice her share of the matrimonial assets. The judge noted that the husband claimed the couple's total assets were worth around $2.3 million, and the sale proceeds would only represent 15% of that pool. This case highlights the importance of providing evidence in financial disputes during divorce proceedings and the need for equitable asset distribution. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Can-divorcing-spouse-sell-home-to-pay-gambling-debt-first)\]

The Singapore Court of Appeal ruled that the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) and the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) unlawfully breached the confidentiality of letters from 13 death-row inmates. The court emphasized a prisoner's right to confidentiality in correspondence, which includes legal communications. Although the AGC’s oversight was acknowledged, it was deemed not intentional to gain court advantages. The court upheld nominal damages for a copyright breach but denied damages for breach of confidence, highlighting the need for strict protocols when handling inmate correspondence. This case underscores the importance of maintaining confidentiality rights in the prison context. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Prisons-AGC-acted-unlawfully-in-breach-of-confidence-over-death-row-inmates-letters-Court-of-Appeal)\]
