"Through the lens of law, the world's tale unfurls,  
In Singapore's banks, green finance swirls.  
Cordlife's clients seek justice's light,  
While HDB rules ignite a fight.  
In school halls, a tragedy's echo whirls,  
A somber dance, as the news summary twirls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore has introduced new criteria for banks and financial institutions to reduce the risk of greenwashing and ensure that transition activities meet green criteria over time. The Singapore-Asia Taxonomy covers eight sectors and provides clarity on what constitutes sustainable and transitional financing. The criteria include financing the phasing out of coal-fired power plants, requiring the replacement of electricity with clean energy and the implementation of a just transition plan. To further drive the phasing out of coal, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is launching a Transition Credits Coalition and a US$5 billion blended finance platform. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/COP28-Singapore-sets-new-rules-to-reduce-risk-of-greenwashing-by-banks)\]

The article discusses the legal implications for affected clients of Cordlife, a cord blood banking service in Singapore, after audits revealed that seven of their storage tanks exposed cryopreserved cord blood units to temperatures above acceptable limits. Lawyers stated that affected clients have grounds for legal recourse based on their contracts with Cordlife, but the amount of compensation may be limited depending on the terms of the contract. The Ministry of Health stated that approximately 2,200 cord blood units belonging to around 2,150 clients were damaged. Lawyers advised affected clients to await an official response from Cordlife before considering legal action. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Cordlifes-affected-clients-have-grounds-for-legal-recourse-but-compensation-may-be-limited-based-on-contract-say-lawyers)\]

This article discusses two cases of individuals losing their HDB flats due to illegal rental and breaking HDB rules. In the first case, an owner rented out his entire flat before the minimum occupation period (MOP) was up, using false tenancy agreements to cover up the deed. The HDB repossessed the flat, and the rogue agent was fined and suspended by the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA). In the second case, a couple bought a private home before the end of their MOP, believing they could do so by putting it on trust for their child. They were fined $45,000 and the agent was suspended for six months. These cases highlight the importance of understanding and adhering to HDB rules to avoid severe consequences.

Takeaway: Violating HDB rules, such as renting out a flat before the MOP or buying a private home during the MOP, can result in the loss of the property and hefty fines. It is crucial for homeowners to be aware of and comply with these rules to protect their investments. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Owner-loses-5-room-HDB-flat-after-renting-it-out-illegally)\]
