A 26-year-old man in Singapore successfully terminated a trust for a $4.9 million house. The court ruled in his favor, stating that the trust was genuine and meant to benefit him. The father claimed it was a ploy to avoid paying additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD), but the court found no credible evidence to support this. The judge emphasized that the trust's purpose was to gift the son a legacy property. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Court-grants-bid-by-son-26-to-end-trust-for-49m-house-rejects-dads-claim-it-was-ploy-to-avoid-ABSD)\]
