In the realm of law, stories unfold,  
Siblings' dispute, a fortune untold.  
Singapore's seas, crimes on the rise,  
National security, investments scrutinized.  
Legal landscapes shift, new bills arise,  
In our blog today, legal tales mesmerize.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A dispute between two siblings over the division of $2.8 million in a joint bank account highlights the potential complications of such arrangements. The sister received about $1.4 million when the account was closed, despite contributing only about $250,000. The brother claimed that half of what she received belonged to him, but the court dismissed his case as he failed to prove a trust arrangement. Lessons from the case include the importance of clear conduct, purpose of the arrangement, and supporting documents. The judge hopes that the siblings will reconcile and acknowledge the brother's generosity. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Siblings-fight-for-share-of-28m-in-joint-account)\]

The High Court in Singapore has ruled that Singaporeans can be convicted of crimes committed on international seas or aircraft. The court dismissed an appeal by a man who was convicted of breaking into another passenger's cabin on a cruise ship and stealing her bra. The court stated that the State Courts Act allows for the trial and conviction of Singaporean citizens for offences committed on the high seas as if the offence occurred in Singapore. The court clarified that this interpretation of the law does not result in an overly broad application of the Penal Code, as there must be a clear connection to Singapore. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singaporeans-can-be-convicted-of-crimes-on-international-seas-aircraft-High-Court)\]

Singapore plans to introduce the Significant Investments Review Bill, which will regulate significant investments in critical entities to protect national security. The legislation will apply to both local and foreign investors and will require approval for certain changes in ownership or control. The bill aims to complement existing sector-based legislation and ensure business continuity in crisis situations. The proposed law aligns Singapore with global best practices and reflects a global trend of increased scrutiny of investments to protect crucial industries. The legislation is expected to come into effect in 2024. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Proposed-Bill-will-help-ensure-Spore-stays-open-to-investments-while-protecting-national-security)\]
