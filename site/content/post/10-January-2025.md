In the realm of law and land, where deals unfold,<br>  
A veteran's tale of loans and shares retold.<br>  
Housing dreams in Singapore's vibrant sprawl,<br>  
Stamp duties and governance stand tall.<br>  
Independent voices in corporate halls,<br>  
Echo the need for balance in power's call.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses a legal dispute involving news veteran Chua Chim Kang, who is being sued for repayment of a $990,000 loan related to an education company he co-founded. The lawsuit centers on the alleged improper transfer of shares and breach of a joint cooperation agreement.

Key legal aspects include the authenticity of the share transfer agreement between Chua and his partner, Ms. Lee, which was not disclosed to the third shareholder, Mr. Ren. The trial raises questions about the enforceability of the agreement, particularly concerning clauses requiring notification of share transfers to other investors. 

The implications of this case highlight the importance of transparency in shareholder agreements and the potential legal consequences of failing to adhere to contractual obligations. 

In conclusion, this case serves as a reminder for attorneys to emphasize clear communication and compliance with contractual terms in business arrangements. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/News-veteran-sued-over-990k-loan-said-he-transferred-shares-in-business-before-joining-Mediacorp)\]

The article discusses the property players' Budget wish list ahead of Singapore's Budget 2025, focusing on the need for adjustments to the Additional Buyerâ€™s Stamp Duty (ABSD), housing affordability, and urban rejuvenation initiatives.

Key legal aspects include calls for ABSD reform to alleviate burdens on genuine homebuyers, particularly first-time buyers, and to stimulate foreign investment. Current ABSD regulations impose significant costs on families upgrading their homes, which some industry leaders argue is impractical. Suggestions include lowering ABSD rates and revising the executive condominium model to enhance affordability.

Implications of these changes could lead to a more vibrant real estate market and address the pressing issue of aging public housing. The article emphasizes the importance of urban renewal and collaborative initiatives to sustain Singapore's growth as a wealth hub.

In conclusion, the proposed adjustments could foster a more sustainable and accessible housing market, aligning with Singapore's long-term urban development goals. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/ABSD-tweak-housing-affordability-urban-rejuvenation-lead-property-players-Budget-wish-list)\]

The article discusses the role of independent directors in mitigating potential conflicts of interest arising from the dual roles of a CEO who also serves as executive chairman. 

Key legal aspects include the Code of Corporate Governance's Provision 3.3, which mandates a lead independent director to address conflicts, especially when the chairman lacks independence. The article highlights the importance of independent directors in enhancing corporate governance and serving as intermediaries between shareholders and management. It cites a precedent where independent directors resigned due to governance concerns, signaling the potential for regulatory scrutiny.

In conclusion, the article advocates for separating the roles of chairman and CEO to bolster governance and productivity, suggesting that companies should reconsider the necessity of an executive chairman. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Independent-directors-A-safeguard-on-dual-roles-of-CEO-cum-executive-chairman-Opinion)\]
