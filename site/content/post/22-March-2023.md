## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Lawyer M. Ravi has been suspended for five years for making baseless and grave allegations against the Attorney-General, prosecutors, and the Law Society that undermine the integrity of Singapore's justice system. The Court of Three Judges found that Mr Ravi's misconduct exhibited a fundamental lack of respect and a blatant disregard for the integrity of Singapore's key legal institutions. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Lawyer-M-Ravi-suspended-for-5-years-over-baseless-allegations-against-Attorney-General-Law-Society)\]

An 84-year-old woman has been allowed to claim $39,000 in government subsidies and grants used to pay for her medical bills after a traffic accident. However, she will have to return the amount, less legal costs, to the Ministry of Health (MOH). The judge said that the subsidies and grants were specifically conferred upon Madam Eng and were akin to collateral benefits that fall within the benevolence exception. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Accident-victim-can-claim-govt-medical-subsidies-but-has-to-return-sum-to-MOH)\]

Singapore has introduced a new legislative framework for psychoactive substances, which criminalises their trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession and consumption. The amendments increase penalties for drug possession, with a maximum jail sentence of 30 years. The new laws aim to keep pace with the evolving drug landscape and local trends, and provide defences for legitimate use of substances. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Spore-changes-laws-to-tackle-new-psychoactive-substances-increases-penalties-for-drug-possession)\]

Singapore will retain a network of vaccination centres for Covid-19 booster shots and amend laws for a wider range of public health scenarios. The Health Ministry will restructure and the Infectious Diseases Act will be amended with four tiers. Singapore is investing in vaccine research and development and has anchored six vaccine manufacturing plants there. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-to-increase-healthcare-capacity-amend-laws-for-future-health-crises)\]

Singapore proposes Workplace Fairness Legislation to ban discrimination in the workplace based on various characteristics. Feminist groups advocate for universal protection against all forms of discrimination. A universal approach to workplace fairness is crucial for retention, engagement, and performance in a workforce. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Workplace-fairness-proposals-could-be-fairer-Opinion)\]
