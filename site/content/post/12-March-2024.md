  "In the dance of law, where truth and justice twirl,  
  Bribery charges, succession plans unfurl.  
  AI in the courtroom, a new world unfurls,  
  In the rhythm of news, the story whirls.  
  In the grand theatre of life, as the drama swirls,  
  We pen the script, as each scene unfurls."

"In the dance of law, where truth and justice twirl,  
Bribery charges, succession plans unfurl.  
AI in the courtroom, a new world unfurls,  
In the rhythm of news, the story whirls.  
In the grand theatre of life, as the drama swirls,  
We pen the script, as each scene unfurls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Daniel Chan, former director of Fullerton Healthcare Corporation, will plead not guilty to charges of corruption and falsifying entertainment claims. Chan, along with fellow co-founders David Sin and Michael Tan, is accused of providing bribes and gratification to Collin Chiew, former CEO of insurance broker Aon Risk Solutions, to advance Fullerton Health's business interests. The prosecution plans to proceed with four of the 13 charges against Chan, while the other nine will be considered during sentencing. Chan's co-accused will also face trial, and they have pre-trial conferences scheduled for April. Fullerton Health is now owned by its largest creditor, RRJ Capital. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Fullerton-Health-ex-director-to-plead-not-guilty-as-corruption-case-against-co-founders-moves-to-trial)\]

Withers KhattarWong (WKW) has announced the appointment of two joint managing partners, Shashi Nathan and Daniel Yong, as part of its succession planning.

The decision to have two co-heads reflects the demands of the business. Deborah Barker, the outgoing managing partner, will step down to focus on her litigation and arbitration practice.
