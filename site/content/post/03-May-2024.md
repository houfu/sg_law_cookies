"In the heart of law, where truth and justice twine,<br>  
A web of tales, in brief summaries, align.<br>  
From Singapore's halls to Tokyo's steamy mist,<br>  
In every story, a legal twist.<br>  
In the dance of words, the world's pulse we find,<br>  
In the rhythm of news, we read the signs."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singaporean Cabinet ministers K. Shanmugam and Vivian Balakrishnan are seeking aggravated damages against Lee Hsien Yang for defaming them in a public Facebook post about their rental of state bungalows. The ministers appeared in court to assess the amount of damages they are entitled to, with their lawyer arguing that Lee's conduct had aggravated the injury caused by his defamatory post. The lawyer compared Lee's conduct to that of another defamation case involving Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, where general and aggravated damages were awarded. The ministers argue that the higher the standing of the defamer, the greater the impact of the defamation and the degree of injury. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Shanmugam-Vivian-seeking-aggravated-damages-over-post-by-Lee-Hsien-Yang)\]

This article reports on a fatal car accident in Singapore involving a lorry driver and an NUS law professor. The driver initially claimed that he fell asleep at the wheel, but later changed his statement, stating that he lost control of the vehicle while checking his GPS on his phone. The driver admitted to constantly checking the GPS as he was unfamiliar with the area. The court heard that the accident resulted in the death of the law professor, who suffered severe injuries. The case will continue on May 10. 

The main legal aspect of this case is the driver's admission of being distracted by his GPS, which may be considered negligence. Precedents involving distracted driving and their legal consequences may be relevant. The implications of this case are the potential liability of the driver for causing the accident and the resulting death. The takeaway from this article is the importance of avoiding distractions while driving, as they can have severe consequences and lead to legal ramifications. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Driver-in-crash-that-killed-NUS-law-professor-was-checking-GPS-on-phone)\]

Cordlife, a cord blood banking facility in Singapore, has received a letter of demand from a client's lawyer for breach of a service agreement and breach of duty of care in negligence.

If Cordlife is required to settle these claims, it may have a negative impact on its financial position. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Cordlife-receives-first-letter-of-demand-from-client-for-breach-of-contract)\]
