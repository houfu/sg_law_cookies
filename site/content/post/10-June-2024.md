"Ten convicted, more to chase, in money's tainted dance, <br>  
In Singapore's strict embrace, no rogue gets a second chance. <br>  
Siblings squabble, properties split, a legacy's bitter pill, <br>  
A will's absence fans the conflict, stirs the familial chill. <br>  
In this world of swirling news, where truth and justice twine, <br>  
We seek the essence, the distilled views, in each revealing line."

This article discusses a case in Singapore where four siblings fought over their father's properties after his death. The father died without a will, so the two shophouses worth $5 million had to be distributed equally among the siblings.

A judge ordered the appointment of a lawyer to handle the valuation and sale of the properties to resolve the disputes.

In a $3 billion money laundering case, the last of the 10 individuals to plead guilty, Cypriot national Wang Dehai, was sentenced to 16 months in jail and agreed to forfeit more than $49 million to the state. Wang was involved in an illegal remote gambling business in the Philippines and received millions of dollars for his role. The prosecution argued that Wang's offenses involved a transnational syndicate and reflected a broader abuse of Singapore's financial infrastructure. The judge rejected the defense's contention that Wang's family circumstances warranted a reduction in sentence, stating that Wang had chosen to flout the country's laws. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/3b-money-laundering-case-Last-of-10-people-to-plead-guilty-given-longest-jail-term-of-16-months)\]
