In Singapore's strict embrace, laws hold sway,<br>  
From scams of nickel to Reits' prudent play.<br>  
Illegal hires face justice's stern gaze,<br>  
While ads for pills find no public praise.<br>  
Regulations weave a protective thread,<br>  
Guarding the realm where commerce treads.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the investigation of the popular eatery ABC Nasi Kandar by Singapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for potential illegal employment offenses, specifically under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. 

Key legal aspects include the scrutiny of ABC Nasi Kandar for hiring foreign workers without valid work passes, which can lead to fines ranging from $5,000 to $30,000 and imprisonment for up to 12 months. Repeat offenders face mandatory jail terms. The implications extend to foreign workers, who may also face significant penalties, including fines and potential bans from working in Singapore.

In conclusion, this investigation underscores the stringent enforcement of employment laws in Singapore, highlighting the severe consequences for both employers and employees involved in illegal employment practices. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Popular-eatery-ABC-Nasi-Kandar-being-investigated-for-illegal-employment-offences)\]

The article discusses the ongoing trial of Ng Yu Zhi, accused of orchestrating a $1.5 billion nickel-trading scam, with a focus on the defense's cross-examination of investor Veronica Shim. 

Key legal aspects include accusations against Shim for prioritizing revenue over the legitimacy of the nickel transactions, raising questions about due diligence in investment practices. The defense aims to establish that Shim's firm, Envysion Wealth Management, was complicit in the scheme, as they received significant fees from investments in Ng's companies. The trial also highlights potential implications under the Securities and Futures Act and the Official Secrets Act, as Shim faces charges for her involvement.

In conclusion, this case underscores the critical importance of thorough due diligence in investment schemes and raises questions about investor accountability in fraudulent scenarios. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/15b-nickel-trading-scam-Defence-accuses-investor-of-caring-only-about-revenue)\]

The article discusses the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Sciences Authority (HSA) in Singapore prohibiting advertisements for prescription-only medications, specifically weight-loss drugs, across all media platforms. This decision follows the emergence of online ads promoting such drugs via telehealth services.

Key legal aspects include the enforcement of the Health Products (Advertisement of Specified Health Products) Regulations 2016, which categorically disallow any form of advertisement for prescription medications. The MOH and HSA emphasize that any promotion, even indirectly, constitutes a violation. Precedents are set by prior actions against telehealth operators who attempted to market GLP-1 drugs through creative naming and imagery.

The implications of this ruling extend to safeguarding public health, particularly preventing misuse of prescription medications among vulnerable populations, such as those with eating disorders. The article underscores the need for compliance and the potential legal repercussions for telehealth providers.

In conclusion, the MOH and HSA's stance reinforces strict regulations on the advertisement of prescription drugs, aiming to protect consumers and ensure responsible marketing practices in the healthcare sector. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Ads-for-prescription-only-medicines-such-as-weight-loss-drugs-prohibited-in-all-forms-of-media-MOH)\]

The article discusses recent regulatory changes by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits), aimed at enhancing investor protection and promoting prudent borrowing practices.

Key legal aspects include the introduction of a minimum interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 1.5 times and an aggregate leverage limit of 50% for all Reits. These measures are designed to ensure Reits can meet their interest obligations while maintaining operational flexibility. The new disclosure requirements mandate that Reit managers analyze and disclose the impact of potential earnings drops and interest rate increases on their ICR, fostering greater accountability.

In conclusion, these regulatory updates reflect a commitment to investor protection and financial prudence, providing a balanced approach to managing risks associated with Reit investments. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-Reits-get-new-leverage-caps-and-tighter-disclosure-requirements-from-MAS)\]
