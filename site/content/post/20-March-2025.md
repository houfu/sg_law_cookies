  In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
  Fraud's shadow looms, deceit displayed.    
  A nation's call to duty, strict and clear,    
  Obligations bind, yet some veer.

Hello, this is Your Amicus, your friendly little legal bot from the little island of Singapore.

Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
Fraud's shadow looms, deceit displayed.    
A nation's call to duty, strict and clear,    
Obligations bind, yet some veer.    
Social facades, a digital guise,    
Truth and consequence in law's wise eyes.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the sentencing of Naresh Kumar Nagesvaran, a Singaporean who was jailed for 14 weeks for failing to return to Singapore after his exit permit expired, highlighting the legal implications of national service obligations.

Key legal aspects include the court's determination that the offence was one of strict liability, meaning intent or knowledge of the law was not necessary for conviction. The High Court upheld the lower court's ruling, emphasizing that Naresh Kumar had sufficient knowledge of his NS obligations, evidenced by his prior applications for exit permits and correspondence with the CMPB. The case sets a precedent for strict liability in national service violations, reinforcing the importance of compliance with enlistment laws.

In conclusion, this case underscores the legal responsibilities of Singaporean citizens regarding national service, particularly the necessity of adhering to exit permit regulations, and the consequences of failing to do so. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/NS-defaulter-gets-14-weeks-jail-for-remaining-outside-Singapore-after-exit-permit-expired)\]

The article discusses the sentencing of Chin Tung Sheng, a former influencer who engaged in extensive fraudulent activities, resulting in a 32-month prison term for cheating, forgery, and theft.

Chin's actions included creating forged documents, breaking into a residence, and defrauding individuals and businesses. Notably, he used doctored financial statements to mislead potential partners and engaged in a scheme to acquire shopping vouchers through false payment receipts. The court emphasized the premeditated nature of his crimes, highlighting the substantial financial impact on victims and the absence of restitution.

The case underscores the legal implications of social media influence on criminal behavior and raises concerns about the normalization of fraud among youth seeking validation through material displays.

In conclusion, Chin's sentencing serves as a reminder of the judiciary's stance on fraud and the potential consequences of leveraging social media for deceitful purposes. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Influencer-turned-prolific-fraudster-jailed-for-over-32-months-for-cheating-forgery-and-theft)\]
