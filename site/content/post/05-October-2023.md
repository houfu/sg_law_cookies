In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From failed lawsuits to laws taking hold.  
Flexible work arrangements seek their place,  
While trade zones tighten their embrace.  
Societies face scrutiny, registration refined,  
And a legal luminary joins a firm, aligned.  
These legal tales, in verse, we now unfold,  
Welcome to today's blog post, behold!

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Singapore School Transport Association (SSTA) has failed in its lawsuit against a former deputy chairman, Mr Ang Chee Seng, over subcontracts awarded during the Covid-19 circuit breaker. The court found that Mr Ang had breached his fiduciary duties but the SSTA failed to provide evidence of the alleged losses. Mr Ang had awarded transport service contracts to two operators without informing the association's executive committee. The association and its business arm, SSTA, sued Mr Ang for alleged losses of over $200,000, but the court dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/School-bus-association-fails-in-lawsuit-over-subcontracts-during-Covid-19-circuit-breaker)\]

Workers' Party MP Louis Chua has proposed enshrining flexible work arrangements (FWAs) into law in Singapore. Currently, there is no legal requirement for employers to offer FWAs. Chua argues that legislation would protect workers such as parents, caregivers, and people with disabilities. He highlighted the low total fertility rate and the reluctance of some employees to have children due to career and lifestyle concerns. Chua also emphasized the need for fair assessment of workers' performance, regardless of whether they take up FWAs or not. Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang acknowledged the importance of FWAs but cautioned against rigid implementation, emphasizing the need for a supportive ecosystem that includes other initiatives such as subsidized care services and caregiver support networks. Tripartite guidelines on FWAs will be introduced in 2024. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Workers-Partys-Louis-Chua-seeks-to-enshrine-flexi-work-arrangements-into-law)\]

Singapore is amending the Free Trade Zones Act to regulate and control goods flowing through its free-trade zones (FTZs). The amendments include introducing a licensing regime for FTZ operators, new regulations for cargo handlers, and increased enforcement powers for Customs authorities. The changes are necessary to combat illicit activities such as weapons proliferation and trade-based money laundering. The amendments aim to strike a balance between better governance and maintaining a business-friendly environment. Implementation of the provisions will begin in early 2024, with a six-month adjustment period for companies. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-to-amend-Free-Trade-Zones-Act-to-combat-illegal-trading-activities)\]

Singapore has passed the Societies (Amendment) Bill, which strengthens the registration process for societies and gives more power to the Registrar of Societies to ask questions and reject suspicious applications. The changes aim to safeguard against societies that may pose a threat to Singapore's safety and security or act contrary to the nation's interests. Previously, applications for societies were processed either through the normal or automatic route, with the latter not requiring any questions or vetting. The amendments now allow the registrar to ask questions and reject applications that may raise concerns. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-laws-to-better-safeguard-against-societies-that-may-pose-a-threat-in-Singapore)\]
