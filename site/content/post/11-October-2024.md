The article discusses the growing trend of appointing lawyers to corporate boards, highlighting the evolving perception of lawyers as valuable contributors beyond legal expertise. Traditionally viewed as superfluous, lawyers are now recognized for their strategic insights on diverse issues, including technology and economic challenges.

Key legal aspects include the cultural differences in board composition between the UK and the US, where lawyers are more prevalent on boards. The article cites a Cornell study showing that lawyer-directors can significantly enhance firm value. However, for lawyers to gain board positions, they must emphasize their business acumen over their legal credentials.
