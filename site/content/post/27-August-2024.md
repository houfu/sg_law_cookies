"In courts of law, where truth and lies entwine,  
Cryptocurrency scams, falsehoods online.  
From Singapore's heart, to the global scene,  
In every tale, a lesson gleaned.  
In this world's dance, both harsh and kind,  
Lies the rhythm of our shared time."

Workers' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh, the opposition leader in Singapore, has requested that his upcoming trial for lying to a parliamentary committee be transferred to the High Court. Singh's lawyer argued that Singh's case, which involves charges of lying to the committee, is similar to the case of former transport minister S. Iswaran, whose trial was transferred to the High Court on grounds of public interest. The prosecution argued that the cases are different and that Singh's trial should remain in the State Courts. The judge will make a decision on the transfer request on September 9.

Blogger and financial adviser Leong Sze Hian has been issued a correction directive under Singapore's fake news law for making false statements about housing grants. Leong claimed in a Facebook post that there is no means testing for grants given for the purchase of resale Housing Board flats. However, the Ministry of National Development (MND) clarified that the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) and CPF Housing Grant (CPF HG) are means-tested. The MND stated that the grants provide targeted support to first-time home buyers, with more support for lower- to middle-income households. Leong will be required to insert a notice with a link to the government's clarification in his original post.
