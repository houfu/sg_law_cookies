## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Justice Kannan Ramesh is the first Singaporean judge to become an international fellow at the American College of Bankruptcy, enhancing Singaporeâ€™s standing in insolvency and restructuring. Singapore has recently improved its insolvency and restructuring laws, including the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act and the Singapore International Commercial Court's new rules. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singaporean-judge-joins-invitation-only-US-insolvency-association-as-international-fellow)\]

Beef Bro co-founder, Norvan Tan, has lost his appeal for sexually assaulting his sister's drunken friend. He will serve nine years and 10 months in jail plus eight strokes of the cane. Tan claimed his innocence and that the victim's recollection was incomplete. The court rejected this and upheld his sentence. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Court-dismisses-Beef-Bro-co-founders-appeal-to-overturn-sentence-for-sexually-assaulting-sisters-drunk-friend)\]

An 18-year-old accused of killing a schoolmate at River Valley High School in 2021 is expected to plead guilty to culpable homicide not amounting to murder in August. The accused allegedly used an axe to repeatedly slash the victim's neck, head, and body. He faces up to 20 years in jail, fines, or caning, but as he was below 18 years old when the offence occurred, he will not be caned. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Teen-accused-of-killing-boy-at-River-Valley-High-School-to-plead-guilty-to-culpable-homicide)\]

The article suggests that Singapore should become more "debtor-friendly" to fulfill its ambition of becoming a hub for international corporate and debt restructuring. The recent Zipmex restructuring case raised issues around determining a foreign entity's "center of main interests" when applying for a moratorium in Singapore, and the article urges Singapore to be more flexible in recognizing foreign insolvency-related judgments and orders. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/An-alternative-paradigm-for-Singapore-jurisdiction-in-cross-border-insolvency-Opinion)\]
