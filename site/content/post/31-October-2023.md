In Singapore's legal realm, stories unfold,  
From economic zones to traders bold.  
Grab's acquisitions raise competition fears,  
While Hin Leong's founder testifies, shedding tears.  
Lawyers in a rush, fear not, I'll summarize,  
Today's blog post, with legal tales that mesmerize.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore and Malaysia plan to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone by January 11, 2024. The zone aims to improve the flow of goods and people between the two countries and enhance the Iskandar development region and Singapore. The project will involve a feasibility study to determine the focus and interest from investors and market demand. The zone may include special tax arrangements and initiatives to improve cross-border trade. The leaders also discussed other bilateral issues, including maritime delimitation and water supply. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-Malaysia-aim-to-sign-MOU-on-Johor-Spore-Special-Economic-Zone-by-early-2024-PM-Lee)\]

OK Lim, the founder of oil trader Hin Leong Trading, testified in his own defence in a district court, describing his group of businesses as a "family business" with significant interdependencies. Lim explained that the companies in his empire operated on a "left pocket, right pocket" model, where they would help each other, including with sending funds. Lim, who is facing cheating and forgery charges, also discussed the various companies under his control, his lack of computer skills, and his early days in the oil industry. The trial is ongoing, and separate civil suits are seeking US$3.5 billion from Lim and his children. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/OK-Lim-takes-stand-says-family-oil-trading-business-had-left-pocket-right-pocket-model)\]

Grab's potential acquisitions of Trans-cab and foodpanda have raised concerns about regulatory action due to anti-competition concerns. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has expressed the need to review the competition effects of the acquisition in greater detail, as it could potentially create barriers to expansion and entry for ride-hailing competitors. The way the Trans-cab transaction is handled will set the stage for other deals in the market, as consolidation becomes more prevalent. Analysts have mixed opinions on the potential acquisitions, with some optimistic about industry consolidation and others concerned about regulatory restrictions and weaknesses in the food delivery business model. Grab's need for acquisitions stems from a shortage of drivers and rising costs that have hindered its operations. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Grabs-search-for-inorganic-growth-may-be-curtailed-by-anti-competition-concerns-Opinion)\]
