  "In courts where truth and falsehood intertwine,  
  Nickel scams and kickbacks undermine.  
  In the legal maze, minds fray and unwind,  
  A silent battle, oft confined.  
  In this world of law, so stern and strict,  
  Lies a tale of humanity, in verdicts depicted."

"In courts where truth and falsehood intertwine,  
Nickel scams and kickbacks undermine.  
In the legal maze, minds fray and unwind,  
A silent battle, oft confined.  
In this world of law, so stern and strict,  
Lies a tale of humanity, in verdicts depicted."
