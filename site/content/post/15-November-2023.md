"From Singapore's stand 'gainst laundering's blight, <br>  
To judges trained in climate's fight, <br>  
And MSMEs gaining financial might, <br>  
In every corner, law's beacon alights. <br>  
In this world's vast, unfolding swirl, <br>  
Unfolds the tale of justice's twirl."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore's handling of a $2.8 billion money laundering case has been praised by the United Arab Emirates' head of anti-money laundering, who describes it as a case of global significance. The UAE official hopes that Singapore's actions will inspire other jurisdictions to take similar measures to combat money laundering. He emphasizes the need for international cooperation to effectively deal with money laundering, as it typically involves multiple jurisdictions. The official also highlights the risks posed by money laundering to economic stability, competition, and confidence in the global financial system. The article mentions that several of the accused individuals in the Singapore case have links to the UAE.

A training course was recently held in Indonesia for 69 judges from India, China, and Southeast Asia, including Singapore, to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to handle climate litigation cases. With the rise in green lawsuits worldwide, judges are becoming crucial decision-makers in cases related to climate change and environmental damage. The course focused on sharing best practices, recent case examples, and the importance of considering the latest climate science. The number of climate litigation cases has been increasing, and it is expected to continue growing due to the intensifying impacts of climate change and the growing awareness of its importance. It is essential for judges to have a strong understanding of climate science to make informed decisions on climate-related justice issues. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/See-you-in-court-Training-equips-Asian-judges-for-climate-litigation-cases)\]

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have launched an open global initiative called Universal Trusted Credentials (UTC) to enhance access to financing for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). The initiative proposes a framework for creating credentials that assess the financing worthiness of MSMEs based on both source and derived data. Source data includes information from various sources such as utility providers and trade platforms, while derived data includes additional indicators like financial literacy and past repayment behavior. The UTC is currently being tested in Ghana, and the intention is to fine-tune and test its application across other emerging markets. The aim is to develop a common UTC standard for international interoperability.
