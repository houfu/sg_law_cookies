In the halls of justice, shadows cast,    
Corruption's grip, a tale of the past.    
Integrity's beacon, a guiding light,    
In Singapore's courts, wrongs made right.    
Structures rise, yet rules must bind,    
In law's embrace, safety we find.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Former Singapore transport minister S. Iswaran has been sentenced to 12 months in prison for corruption, significantly exceeding the prosecution's recommendation of six to seven months. Iswaran pleaded guilty to five charges, including accepting valuable gifts from business associates and obstructing justice. The court emphasized the need for integrity in public service, highlighting that high-ranking officials have greater culpability and must set a standard for ethical conduct. Iswaran's case underscores Singapore's strict stance on corruption, with potential implications for public trust and governance. He has 14 days to appeal, during which he may apply for bail. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Iswaran-gets-12-months-jail-sentence-nearly-double-what-prosecution-sought)\]
