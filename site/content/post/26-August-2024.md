  "From Singapore's AI, a future unfurls,  
  In courts, justice weighs, as truth whirls.  
  Finance portals dance, in rivalry's twirl,  
  While gold bars hide, in deceit's curl.  
  In this world's stage, the drama unfurls,  
  News summaries spun, as the globe whirls."

"From Singapore's AI, a future unfurls,  
In courts, justice weighs, as truth whirls.  
Finance portals dance, in rivalry's twirl,  
While gold bars hide, in deceit's curl.  
In this world's stage, the drama unfurls,  
News summaries spun, as the globe whirls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singapore has adopted a nuanced approach to regulating AI, focusing on both AI adoption and consumer protection. While there are no immediate plans for overarching AI regulation, existing laws are relied upon to address harms associated with AI and can be updated if needed. Singapore has introduced new laws to support AI use, clarified how existing regulations apply to AI systems, and issued regulatory guidance. Efforts are also being made to develop AI testing and certification capabilities, along with promoting ethical AI practices through professional training. This approach aims to support AI innovation while safeguarding society. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapores-twin-engine-approach-to-AI-regulation-Opinion)\]

A young man in Singapore who raped a 13-year-old girl while on the run has been sentenced to over nine years in jail but spared caning due to his mild intellectual disability. The man had previously been released on supervision from reformative training for committing rape when he cut his electronic tag and became uncontactable. The judge decided not to impose caning despite prosecutors seeking six strokes, citing the defendant's disability. The man pleaded guilty to statutory rape, mischief for cutting his e-tag, and acting as a money mule. Another four charges were considered during sentencing. 

Takeaway: The judge's decision to spare the defendant caning due to his mild intellectual disability highlights the consideration of individual circumstances in sentencing. This case underscores the importance of supervision and monitoring of individuals released on parole or supervision schemes and the potential risks associated with non-compliance. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Man-who-raped-13-year-old-girl-while-on-the-run-gets-jail-but-spared-caning)\]

MoneySmart Group, a personal finance portal, has rejected an $8 million acquisition offer from its competitor MoneyHero Group. MoneySmart cited that the offer was not serious or credible and that it did not align with the company's strategic objectives. MoneySmart also noted that the proposed merger would fail to deliver value to its shareholders. MoneyHero, on the other hand, believes that the acquisition would strengthen their leadership in Southeast Asia and provide synergies for shareholders and customers. Both companies operate online financial product comparison platforms and are considered rivals. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/MoneySmart-rejects-acquisition-offer-from-rival-MoneyHero)\]

Kim Taek Hoon, a 63-year-old South Korean man in Singapore, is facing over 20 charges, including cheating and money laundering. He allegedly used more than $1.5 billion in ill-gotten gains to purchase nearly 28,000 gold bars weighing 1kg each. Kim is accused of cheating Singapore Customs and three logistics companies by declaring shipments as air-powered tools when they actually contained over 23,000 gold bars. He also failed to declare the receipt of cash from overseas, which is required when the value exceeds $20,000. If convicted, Kim could face imprisonment and fines. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Man-allegedly-bought-gold-bars-with-15b-in-ill-gotten-gains-hid-23000-of-them-in-shipments)\]
