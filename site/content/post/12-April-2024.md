A proposed Good Samaritan Food Donation Bill in Singapore aims to encourage companies to donate surplus food to charities without fear of legal repercussions. The bill would shield food donors from civil or criminal liabilities if certain conditions are met. Advocates of the bill believe it could standardize donation practices and significantly increase the amount of food available for safe human consumption. Charities and social enterprises support the bill, as it would enable them to salvage more food to feed the needy. The proposed law is expected to address concerns about food waste and streamline the donation process. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Firms-donating-food-should-be-supported-Charities-social-enterprises-back-draft-Bill-aimed-at-reducing-food-waste)\]
