  "In the court's stern gaze, falsehoods unfurl,  
  Defamation's price, a costly pearl.  
  Cyclists in line, data breaches twirl,  
  In Singapore's grasp, the law's firm curl.  
  In the dance of justice, truths whirl,  
  In the world's grand stage, stories unfurl."

"In the court's stern gaze, falsehoods unfurl,  
Defamation's price, a costly pearl.  
Cyclists in line, data breaches twirl,  
In Singapore's grasp, the law's firm curl.  
In the dance of justice, truths whirl,  
In the world's grand stage, stories unfurl."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Lee Hsien Yang has been ordered by the High Court in Singapore to pay $200,000 each to Cabinet ministers K. Shanmugam and Vivian Balakrishnan for defaming them in a Facebook post. The post falsely alleged that the ministers had acted corruptly by receiving preferential treatment in the rental of state bungalows. The judge found that Lee's defamatory allegations were of the gravest kind, damaging the ministers' personal integrity and professional reputation. The judge also noted that Lee's conduct and malice were worse than previous defamation cases involving Facebook posts. 

In conclusion, Lee Hsien Yang has been ordered to pay substantial damages for defaming two Cabinet ministers in a Facebook post, with the judge highlighting the seriousness of the allegations and the lack of remorse or corrective action from Lee. This case reinforces the legal consequences of making false and damaging statements online, particularly against public figures. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Ridout-Road-rentals-defamation-case-Lee-Hsien-Yang-ordered-to-pay-200k-each-to-Shanmugam-Vivian)\]

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Traffic Police in Singapore have caught over 25 cyclists for flouting group riding rules.

Violators can be fined $150. Group cyclists have expressed challenges in maintaining the required distance and understanding the rationale behind the restrictions. Suggestions to improve road safety for cyclists include education efforts, enforcing a minimum distance for motorists passing cyclists, and building dedicated cycling infrastructure.

Singapore-based software firm PPLingo has been fined $74,000 by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) for a data breach that affected over half a million users. The breach was caused by a weak password, "lingoace123," used for an administrator account that had remained unchanged for over two years. The hacker accessed personal data, including cellphone numbers, bank account numbers, signatures, and identity card numbers, of 557,144 users, including more than 300,000 minors. The commission found that the company had failed to implement reasonable security arrangements and did not appoint anyone to ensure compliance with data protection laws. PDPC also fined ferry operator Horizon Fast Ferry $28,000 for a data leak affecting nearly 108,500 people. Both cases highlight the importance of implementing strong password policies and reasonable security measures to protect personal data.

In conclusion, the fines imposed on PPLingo and Horizon Fast Ferry underscore the significance of implementing robust security measures and password policies to safeguard personal data. These cases also highlight the accountability of companies for the protection of all personal data in their possession, regardless of the individuals' locations. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Software-firm-fined-74k-for-data-breach-caused-by-weak-password-half-a-million-users-affected)\]
