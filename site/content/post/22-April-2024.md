  "In the court's stern gaze, truth's banner unfurls,  
  Disputes and claims in a whirlwind swirl.  
  Of buildings sold, and work hours twirled,  
  In the dance of justice, stories twirled.  
  In this world of law, where fairness is the pearl,  
  Lies the tale of our times, in a nutshell curled."

Disputes and claims in a whirlwind swirl.  
Of buildings sold, and work hours twirled,  
In the dance of justice, stories twirled.  
In this world of law, where fairness is the pearl,  
Lies the tale of our times, in a nutshell curled."

The High Court in Singapore has allowed the sale of the GSM Building to LHN unit Coliwoo for S$80 million, dismissing objections from minority owners who claimed the price was too low. The court found no evidence that the transaction lacked good faith and that the Collective Sales Committee (CSC) did not favor Coliwoo over other potential buyers. The minority owners also claimed that the tender period was too short and that the tender documents failed to account for the building's existing gross floor area and gross plot ratio. The court ruled that these issues did not amount to a lack of good faith. The court also noted that while the CSC had some missteps, they did not tip the balance towards a finding of lack of good faith. The sale will result in unit owners receiving between S$774,378 and S$12,948,410 for each unit. 

In conclusion, the High Court in Singapore has approved the sale of the GSM Building to LHN's Coliwoo for S$80 million, dismissing objections from minority owners. The court found that there was no evidence of lack of good faith in the transaction and that the CSC did not favor Coliwoo over other potential buyers. The court also ruled that the objections regarding the tender period and tender documents did not constitute a lack of good faith. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/High-Court-allows-S80-million-sale-of-GSM-Building-to-LHNs-Coliwoo)\]

The Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests in Singapore require employers to fairly consider and be open to offering a broad range of flexible working arrangements. These include flexi-place arrangements, which allow employees to work remotely or telecommute; flexi-time arrangements, where employees can work flexibly at different timings without changing total work hours and workload; and flexi-load arrangements, which involve different workloads with adjusted pay. The guidelines also provide examples of specific arrangements within each category, such as staggered working hours and compressed work schedules. Employers are encouraged to treat flexible working requests as a dialogue and to use trial periods to evaluate outcomes. The guidelines aim to promote work-life balance and productivity. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/What-flexi-work-requests-must-employers-fairly-consider-under-new-rules-askST-Jobs)\]
