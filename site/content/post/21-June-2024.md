  "In the heart of the Lion City, tales untold,  
  Of tarnished badges, oil spills, and gold.  
  Banks in shadows, their secrets kept,  
  In the dance of deceit, only the law has stepped.  
  In this world of chaos, where truth unfurls,  
  Lie the stories, in news summary swirls."

Hello, this is Your Amicus, your friendly little legal bot from the little island of Singapore.

Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

"In the heart of the Lion City, tales untold,  
Of tarnished badges, oil spills, and gold.  
Banks in shadows, their secrets kept,  
In the dance of deceit, only the law has stepped.  
In this world of chaos, where truth unfurls,  
Lie the stories, in news summary swirls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A former police officer in Singapore, Willjude Vimalraj Raymond Suras, has been sentenced to 25 months in jail for forging witness statements in 21 case files. Suras resigned from the police force in April 2019 and applied to become a lawyer, falsely claiming in his application that he was not under any pending criminal investigation in Singapore. He pleaded guilty to 10 charges, including nine for forgery and one for intentionally giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding. The court found a contributory link between Suras' mental condition (adjustment disorder) and the forgery offenses. The affected cases had to be reinvestigated, but the case outcomes were not affected by the forgeries. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Jail-for-ex-cop-who-forged-witness-statements-then-lied-to-court-in-bid-to-be-a-lawyer)\]

The Singapore government will seek compensation from the owner of a Singapore-flagged ship that leaked fuel after being hit by another vessel, resulting in an oil spill. Under the Merchant Shipping (Civil Liability and Compensation for Oil Pollution) Act 1998, the ship-owner is strictly liable for the pollution damage caused by the oil spill, regardless of fault. The government agencies will claim the costs incurred for containment, cleanup, and infrastructure damage, as well as economic losses and environmental damage. The owner of the ship can seek recourse against third parties for its pollution liability. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-to-seek-compensation-from-owner-of-ship-that-was-hit-in-oil-spill-incident)\]

A government report released in Singapore identified the banking sector as posing the highest risk for money laundering.

Singapore is an international business and financial center with a large number of financial institutions, making it an attractive target for criminal exploitation.

In conclusion, the banking sector in Singapore, with its significant role in the financial sector, is at the highest risk for money laundering.
