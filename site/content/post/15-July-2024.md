A Singaporean businessman lost over $2 million when he hastily invested in a purported cryptocurrency bank without conducting proper due diligence. The businessman was offered a chance to buy a quarter stake in the "Royal Eastern Bank" without verifying the deal's authenticity or the bank's true value. The High Court Judge found that the investment was a scam and there was never going to be a licensed operational bank. The investor was entitled to ask for his money back, but he still lost over $2 million as one of the partners had already returned the majority of the funds. The case highlights the importance of conducting thorough background checks, dealing with reputable and licensed businesses, and scrutinizing financial claims and self-generated documents. 

Conclusion: This case serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of hasty investments and the need for careful due diligence. Investors should exercise skepticism, verify financial claims, and ensure they deal with reputable and licensed businesses to mitigate the risk of scams and financial losses. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/How-a-Spore-businessman-lost-over-2m-in-haste-to-invest-in-a-crypto-bank)\]

The estate of businessman Spencer Tuppani, who was killed by his father-in-law in 2017, has lost an appeal to recover a luxury watch that he was wearing at the time of his death. The estate administrators sued Tuppani's parents to retrieve the watch or be compensated for its value. However, the High Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the lower court's decision that the parents' actions did not amount to conversion. The court found that the father-in-law's act of leaving the watch at Tuppani's residence did not interfere with the administrators' rights over the watch. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Estate-of-businessman-killed-by-father-in-law-fails-in-appeal-to-get-back-luxury-watch)\]
