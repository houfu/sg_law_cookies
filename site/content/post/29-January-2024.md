"In the web of tech and law, where justice twirls,  
Beneath data's breach, a threat unfurls.  
Youth in danger, innocence in peril,  
Reformative training, a path to renewal.  
In these news summaries, the world whirls,  
A snapshot of time, as the day unfurls."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the rise of technology-facilitated sexual harm, particularly through the use of deepfake videos and AI-generated images.

The article also mentions the efforts of organizations like SG Her Empowerment (SHE) in addressing these issues and providing support to victims. It concludes by mentioning the regulatory measures taken to regulate online spaces and provides contact information for helplines and support centers.

In summary, the article focuses on the increase in technology-facilitated sexual harm, particularly through deepfakes and AI-generated images.

The article discusses the need for stronger data protection rules and measures in Singapore, as cyber attacks and data breaches continue to rise. It highlights a recent data breach at healthcare provider Fullerton Health Group, where the personal data of over 320,000 people was stolen and put up for sale online. The breach resulted in a fine of $58,000 imposed by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). Experts argue that financial penalties alone are not enough of a deterrent and that a more preventive approach, such as higher industry standards and the sharing of best practices, should be adopted to enhance data security.

In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of beefing up personal data protection rules in Singapore to prevent further breaches and protect individuals' confidential information. It suggests that stronger pre-emptive measures, rather than just financial penalties, should be implemented to enhance data security and prevent cyber attacks. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Is-your-confidential-info-safe-More-can-be-done-to-beef-up-personal-data-protection-rules-say-experts)\]

The article discusses the concept of composition, which is a way of settling a criminal case in Singapore. Composition allows for the diversion of minor offenders from the courts, saving time and resources. When an offence is compounded, the accused is not convicted and is treated as innocent. The accused may receive a letter offering composition, which involves paying a sum of money in exchange for not being charged or being discharged with acquittal. Composition is offered for certain specified offences, such as outraging modesty, and it prevents the accused from having a criminal record. However, recent cases involving serious offences like outrage of modesty have sparked discussion about the use of composition in such cases. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Why-an-offence-like-molestation-can-be-compounded-and-the-accused-is-acquitted-Explainer)\]

The article discusses the increasing number of cases involving teenagers who are sexually exploited by individuals they meet online. Lawyers and counselors have observed a rise in such cases, with victims as young as 10 years old. The cases can be categorized into two groups: those involving victims seeking love or attention online and falling prey to predators, and those where teens engage in sexual or companionship services for money. The article also highlights recent court cases where perpetrators were prosecuted for sexual penetration of minors. Counselors attribute the increase in these cases to teenagers spending more time online during the pandemic. It is important for parents to be vigilant and supervise their children's online activities to protect them from online sexual exploitation. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-teens-sexually-exploited-by-online-predators-many-cases-unreported-Lawyers-and-counsellors)\]

Reformative training is a rehabilitative regime in Singapore that is available to offenders between the ages of 16 and 21, and in certain cases, offenders aged 14 or 15 who have previously been ordered to a juvenile rehabilitation center. The regime aims to reform offenders and reintegrate them into society. It involves a residential phase of up to 36 months and a statutory supervision phase of up to 54 months. During the residential phase, offenders undergo various programs such as psychology-based correctional programs and personal development programs. Reformative training has a stronger focus on rehabilitation compared to imprisonment, and it results in a criminal record. The wide range of offenses considered under reformative training is because the regime prioritizes rehabilitation as the main sentencing objective for young offenders. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/What-is-reformative-training-and-why-is-it-used-in-wide-range-of-cases-from-e-cigarette-sales-to-rape-Explainer)\]
