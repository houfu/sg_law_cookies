In Singapore's evolving legal scene,    
Where justice and safety convene,    
Online harms face a new decree,    
While scams meet caning's harsh plea.    
Psychologists find their rightful place,    
As flexible work reshapes the race.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the establishment of the Online Safety Commission in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, aimed at providing faster recourse for victims of online harms such as cyberbullying and non-consensual image sharing. 

Key legal aspects include the introduction of the Online Safety (Relief and Accountability) Bill, which will empower the Commission to order the removal of harmful content and allow victims to sue perpetrators and platforms. This initiative mirrors Australia’s eSafety Commissioner model, emphasizing rapid response to online threats. Additionally, it complements existing laws like the Broadcasting Act and Protection from Harassment Act.

In conclusion, the upcoming legislation represents a significant step toward enhancing online safety and accountability, offering victims more robust legal remedies and support. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-online-harms-support-centre-to-operate-from-2026-will-offer-victims-faster-recourse)\]

The article discusses the potential implementation of caning as a punishment for scammers and money mules in Singapore, prompted by rising scam incidents and significant financial losses among victims. 

Key legal aspects include the consideration of caning as a deterrent, especially for offenses related to scams, which have caused over $3.4 billion in losses since 2019. Current penalties for money mules include fines and imprisonment under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Offences Act and the Computer Misuse Act, but do not include caning. The Ministry of Home Affairs is contemplating this change, citing the severe harm caused to victims.

The implications of introducing caning could mirror its effects on loan shark harassment cases, which saw a significant decrease following its implementation. However, legal experts express concerns about proportionality and the potential for rehabilitation versus punishment.

In conclusion, while caning may serve as a strong deterrent, balancing punitive measures with educational and rehabilitative approaches is essential for effectively addressing the underlying issues of scam-related offenses. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Would-caning-scammers-and-money-mules-reduce-the-number-of-scam-cases)\]

This article discusses a complex legal dispute involving an employee who lent a significant sum to her boss, only to face termination and a defamation lawsuit when she sought repayment. 

Key legal aspects include the importance of documentation in financial transactions, as the employee failed to prove that her transfers were personal loans rather than corporate loans. The court ruled against her in both her debt recovery claim and the defamation suit, emphasizing that without clear evidence of a personal loan, her claims lacked merit. The High Court ultimately reduced the defamation damages awarded to the boss, highlighting the diminished reputation due to his own company’s financial mismanagement.

In conclusion, this case underscores the critical need for written agreements in financial dealings to avoid disputes and protect one’s interests. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/When-an-employee-gets-fired-and-sued-after-helping-boss-with-120k)\]

**Summary of Legal Developments in Singapore's Psychological Services Regulation**

Singapore is set to implement a registration system for psychologists to enhance patient safety and public trust in mental health services. The initiative, announced by Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary, aims to establish legal standards for practitioners, addressing concerns over unregulated practices that could jeopardize client safety. 

Key legal aspects include the formation of an inter-agency committee to oversee the registration process and the recognition that only psychiatrists are currently regulated. The move responds to rising mental health issues, particularly post-COVID-19. Psychologists have expressed strong support, emphasizing the need for accountability and ethical standards to mitigate risks associated with unqualified practitioners. 

The Ministry of Health will also review advertising regulations under the Healthcare Services Act to ensure accurate public information while maintaining safety. Additionally, plans to improve access to youth mental health services are underway, with guidelines on parental consent for minors being developed.

In conclusion, the proposed regulations mark a significant shift towards formalizing psychological practice in Singapore, aiming to enhance service quality and patient safety while addressing operational challenges during the transition. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Singapore-to-register-psychologists-to-safeguard-patient-safety-boost-public-confidence)\]

The article discusses the increasing adoption of flexible work arrangements by Singapore companies in 2024 and the government's support initiatives aimed at enhancing workforce inclusivity and reskilling.

Key legal aspects include the introduction of the Career Conversion Programmes, which now extend to part-time workers, allowing employers to receive salary support for reskilling mid-career employees. This initiative aligns with the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests, promoting a structured approach for employees to request flexible work options. The recent Workplace Fairness Bill further strengthens protections against discrimination in employment decisions.

In conclusion, the article highlights significant legal developments that facilitate flexible work arrangements and promote fair workplace practices, reflecting a shift towards inclusivity in Singapore's labor market. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/More-Singapore-companies-offering-flexible-work-arrangements-in-2024-than-before)\]
