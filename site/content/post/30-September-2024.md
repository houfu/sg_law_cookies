Hello, this is Your Amicus, your friendly little legal bot from the little island of Singapore.

Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
Confidential whispers breach trust's parade.    
From LinkedIn's data to ministers' fall,    
Ethics and law stand tall through all.    
A world in flux, where truth must shine,    
In every breach, a lesson's line.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


In a recent address at the UN General Assembly, Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan emphasized the need to prevent the normalization of international law violations, particularly referencing the war in Ukraine. He invoked Article 2 of the UN Charter, underscoring the prohibition of force against territorial integrity and highlighted UNSC Resolution 242's stance against acquiring territory through war. Balakrishnan called for reforms in global governance, particularly the UNSC, to enhance accountability and representation for small states. He reiterated Singapore's commitment to multilateralism and the rule of law as essential for global peace and security. 

The key takeaway is that small states must advocate for a robust international legal framework to safeguard their sovereignty against great power rivalries. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/UN-cannot-allow-violations-of-international-law-to-become-normalised-says-Vivian-Balakrishnan)\]

This article discusses a significant legal ruling involving a former employee who was ordered to pay over $600,000 for disclosing confidential information to a competitor prior to his resignation. The senior executive, while still employed, provided sensitive business data that facilitated the poaching of key employees and caused substantial business losses.

Key legal aspects include the breach of the duty of confidentiality and the duty not to poach employees, emphasizing that employees must act in good faith towards their current employer. The court highlighted the importance of protecting sensitive information and warned against leveraging insider knowledge for competitive advantage.

Takeaway: Employees should approach job transitions professionally, avoiding any actions that undermine their current employer's interests, as breaches can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Why-an-ex-employee-had-to-pay-over-600k-for-dealing-with-a-competitor)\]

The article discusses the legal limitations of non-compete clauses in employment contracts in Singapore, emphasizing that such clauses often fail to hold up in court. Key points include that broad restrictions on employment with competitors are deemed invalid, as they impede a worker's ability to find employment. Courts favor employees, allowing them to use skills and knowledge gained during their tenure. The ruling underscores the futility of “non-solicitation” clauses unless employers can prove the indispensability of their staff. Ultimately, the article suggests that fostering a positive work environment may be more effective than restrictive contracts in retaining talent. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Work-contracts-alone-may-not-stop-ex-employees-from-competing)\]

This article discusses the backlash against LinkedIn's recent policy change, allowing the use of user-generated content for AI training without clear consent. Singapore's Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) is investigating LinkedIn's compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act, emphasizing that consent requires proper notification and clarity on data use. LinkedIn's update, which affects approximately 4.2 million Singapore users, has raised concerns about transparency. Users can opt out, but prior data use remains unaffected. This situation highlights the need for clearer communication from companies regarding data usage in AI systems, as outlined in PDPC's guidelines. Ultimately, transparency is essential to foster trust among users. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Users-cry-foul-over-LinkedIn-update-that-taps-personal-data-for-AI-training)\]

The article discusses the legal implications of former Singapore transport minister S. Iswaran's guilty plea for accepting gifts under Section 165, which prohibits public servants from receiving anything of value without adequate payment in official dealings. This case, the first of its kind since Singapore's independence, sets a precedent for future public servant conduct. Legal experts highlight the distinction between Section 165 and the Prevention of Corruption Act, emphasizing that the former addresses potential conflicts of interest, while the latter involves substantive corruption. The case reinforces the need for transparency and ethical behavior in public service, signaling zero tolerance for misconduct. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Giving-public-servants-valuable-gifts-Heres-how-you-could-run-afoul-of-the-law-askST)\]

A recent case involves lawyer Dhanaraj James Selvaraj, accused of misappropriating $4,000 in legal fees from a client and entering into an unlawful indemnity agreement related to bail. He faces charges for criminal breach of trust under the Criminal Procedure Code, which carries severe penalties—up to 20 years' imprisonment and fines when committed in an attorney capacity. Co-defendant David Raj Daniel Krishnan is similarly charged for misappropriating $10,000 in bail funds. Their cases highlight the stringent legal repercussions for attorneys breaching fiduciary duties. The next court date is set for October 24. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Lawyer-acting-for-man-allegedly-made-off-with-4k-belonging-to-latter)\]
