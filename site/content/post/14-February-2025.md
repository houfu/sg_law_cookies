Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In Singapore's stride, a new dawn unfurls,<br>  
With health and markets in transformative swirls.<br>  
A statutory shield for diseases' advance,<br>  
While tax incentives give equities a chance.<br>  
Misleading claims now face the light,<br>  
Truth in trade, a consumer's right.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the establishment of Singapore's new statutory board, the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA), set to launch on April 1, 2025. This initiative aims to consolidate public health functions for more effective disease outbreak responses.

Key legal aspects include the passage of the Communicable Diseases Agency Act 2025, which provides the legislative framework for the CDA. The agency will enhance Singapore's infectious disease management and public health preparedness, reflecting a strategic shift following the Covid-19 response. Professor Vernon Lee, with extensive experience in public health, will lead the CDA.

In conclusion, the formation of the CDA represents a significant legal and operational advancement in Singapore's public health strategy, enabling swift and coordinated responses to infectious disease threats. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-statutory-board-Communicable-Diseases-Agency-to-be-set-up-in-April)\]

The article discusses the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) review group's proposal for tax incentives aimed at revitalizing Singapore’s equities market. 

Key legal aspects include the introduction of tax perks to attract listings and investments, focusing on mid-sized companies and facilitating secondary listings. The review group emphasizes streamlining regulatory processes for initial public offerings (IPOs) to enhance market competitiveness. However, critics argue that tax incentives alone may not address deeper market issues, such as valuation and liquidity concerns.

In conclusion, while the proposed measures represent a positive initial step, their effectiveness will depend on addressing fundamental market dynamics to foster sustainable growth in Singapore's equities market. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/MAS-review-group-proposes-tax-perks-to-boost-Singapores-equities-market-as-a-start)\]

The article discusses the actions taken by Osim in response to concerns raised by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) regarding misleading promotional practices and product information.

CCCS found that Osim's promotional discounts and product labeling were misleading, particularly regarding the use of the “Stanford Medicine” logo, which implied institutional endorsement that did not exist. Additionally, the “Conformite Europeenne” mark was misrepresented as a certification, despite being self-declared. The lack of pre-purchase disclosure about product suitability and misleading pricing practices further exacerbated consumer confusion. 

In response, Osim has amended its marketing strategies, removed misleading logos, improved product information transparency, and committed to an internal compliance policy to align with Singapore's fair trading laws. 

The takeaway emphasizes the importance of accurate representation and disclosure in marketing to foster consumer trust and avoid regulatory scrutiny. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Osim-overhauls-product-details-after-competition-watchdog-raises-concerns)\]
