Independent directors have a duty to act in the best interests of the company and avoid conflicts of interest. Failure to disclose material information can result in legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment. Boards should set out protocols and guides to best practices that directors must comply with when faced with conflicts. Independent directors must stay away from temptation to avoid facing consequences when things go awry. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Disclosure-related-duties-of-directors)\]
