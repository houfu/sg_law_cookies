  "In the courts of Lion City, a new judge takes his stand,  
  In the dance of law and order, he lends a steady hand.  
  In the realm of tiny giants, where corruption's web is spun,  
  A single thread unravels, under the Southeast Asian sun.  
  Greenprint's digital tendrils, in the hands of Ant unfurl,  
  Sowing seeds of sustainability, in the business world's whirl."

"In the courts of Lion City, a new judge takes his stand,  
In the dance of law and order, he lends a steady hand.  
In the realm of tiny giants, where corruption's web is spun,  
A single thread unravels, under the Southeast Asian sun.  
Greenprint's digital tendrils, in the hands of Ant unfurl,  
Sowing seeds of sustainability, in the business world's whirl."
