In Singapore's legal realm we delve,  
From Wirecard woes to rental scams that swelled.  
Henry Yeo, sentenced to prison's embrace,  
While Zeng's deceit left victims in a daze.  
Deposit insurance coverage proposed anew,  
Legal tales unfold, capturing our view.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singaporean Henry Yeo has been sentenced to 12 months in prison for his involvement in the Wirecard case. He pleaded guilty to criminal breach of trust, falsifying invoices, and money laundering, resulting in a loss of S$123,070 for Wirecard Asia. Yeo's lawyer argued for a jail term of 9-12 months, citing his cooperation with authorities and financial struggles. The judge acknowledged Yeo's role but noted it was his first offense. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/12-month-jail-term-for-Singaporean-in-Wirecard-case)\]

Former sales executive Gibson Zeng Xianfu pleaded guilty to cheating 62 victims in one of Singapore's largest rental scams. Zeng advertised unauthorized rental units on Airbnb, scammed victims from 12 countries out of nearly $383,000, and spent the money on himself. He could face up to 10 years in jail. The case highlights the rise in online rental scams in Singapore. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Man-cheated-62-victims-from-at-least-12-countries-of-383k-in-one-of-Spores-largest-rental-scams)\]

MAS proposes raising deposit insurance coverage from S$75,000 to S$100,000 per depositor. This would cover 91% of depositors and clarify compensation calculations. The last review was in 2019, and the percentage of fully insured depositors has slightly fallen to 89% in Q1 2022. These proposals are not a response to recent stresses faced by overseas banks. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/MAS-proposes-to-raise-deposit-insurance-cap-to-S100000)\]
