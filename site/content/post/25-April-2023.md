In Singapore's court, justice prevails,  
As verdicts come through verified tales.  
From coffee shops to forged contracts,   
The law sees through the hollow acts.  
While neighbor disputes do arise,  
A new bill helps families harmonize.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


A Singaporean coffee shop boss has won $340,447.27 in a lawsuit against the family of his deceased friend, who he started a used car business with. The investor had initially invested over $500,000, but was only refunded a small amount after their joint venture ended. The high court ruled that there was sufficient evidence proving the existence of a joint venture agreement and that he was owed the money. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Dead-mans-family-ordered-to-refund-340k-to-coffee-shop-boss-who-invested-in-used-car-business)\]

Noise-related neighbor disputes are complex and difficult to resolve, with mediation being the most effective method.

An effective solution to address this issue is crucial. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Holistic-approach-needed-to-tackle-intractable-problem-of-noise-spats)\]
