"In courts of law where justice's flag unfurls,  
Electric currents spark a greener world.  
Child stars shielded, as the law now twirls,  
Influencers' secrets, like banners, unfurled.  
In the dance of news, each story twirls,  
A poetic summary of a swiftly changing world."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The High Court in Singapore has struck out a constitutional challenge brought by 36 death row inmates against two provisions in the Post-Appeal Applications in Capital Cases Act (Pacc Act). The Pacc Act, which has not yet come into force, aims to prevent death row inmates from abusing the court process to delay their executions. The inmates argued that the provisions were onerous, oppressive, and inconsistent with their rights to a fair trial and access to justice. However, the court found that the inmates had no legal standing because the provisions do not currently affect them, and the new procedure is intended to address the issue of last-minute applications by death row inmates to delay their sentences. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/High-Court-strikes-out-challenge-by-36-death-row-inmates-against-new-post-appeal-process)\]

The Electric Vehicle Charging Act in Singapore will come into effect on December 8, 2023, regulating the safe charging of electric vehicles (EVs) and expanding the accessible charging network. The law requires owners of existing EV chargers to register them with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) by June 7, 2024, with a one-time registration fee. After this date, it will be illegal to use an unregistered charger, with penalties including fines of up to $10,000 or a six-month jail term. Suppliers of EV chargers must have their models approved by the LTA, and operators of public charging services must be licensed by December 7, 2024.
 
Takeaway: The Electric Vehicle Charging Act in Singapore aims to ensure the provision of reliable EV charging services and expand the network of accessible charging infrastructure. The law imposes registration requirements for existing and new EV chargers, with penalties for using unregistered chargers. Suppliers and operators must comply with safety standards and licensing requirements. This legislation reflects Singapore's commitment to the adoption of EVs and the development of a robust charging infrastructure. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-EV-chargers-bought-from-Dec-8-must-be-registered-before-use-under-new-law)\]

The article discusses the increasing importance of embracing AI in the legal profession. AI has the potential to streamline legal work, reduce manual tasks, and enhance the efficiency of legal processes. The article emphasizes that lawyers need to embrace the use of AI to stay competitive, as 44% of current legal work tasks could be automated by AI. The article also highlights the need for lawyers to ask clear and specific questions when interacting with AI platforms, as the quality of the AI's responses depends on the clarity of the queries. The article concludes by noting that while AI is transforming the legal profession, human lawyers still possess unique qualities such as emotional intelligence and judgment, which AI lacks. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/A-senior-lawyers-interaction-with-AI-Learning-to-ask-good-questions-Opinion)\]

The article discusses the growth of influencer marketing and the legal challenges that arise in this industry. One issue highlighted is the lack of protection for child influencers, such as Ryan Kaji, whose parents may squander their earnings. In response, the state of Illinois has passed a law requiring parents to put half of the money earned from videos featuring their children into a trust fund. The article also mentions the importance of ad disclosure to maintain trust in influencers, with non-compliance potentially resulting in industry sanctions. Additionally, the article discusses the need for termination clauses and exclusivity clauses in influencer contracts, as well as copyright concerns for commissioned content. 

Influencer marketing faces legal challenges such as protecting child influencers, ensuring ad disclosure, and addressing copyright concerns. Termination and exclusivity clauses in contracts are important to protect brands, while copyright ownership for commissioned content should be negotiated to avoid infringement claims. The influencer marketing industry continues to grow, and more legislation is expected in the future. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Influencer-marketings-growth-continues-but-the-law-is-still-playing-catch-up-in-many-areas-Commentary)\]
