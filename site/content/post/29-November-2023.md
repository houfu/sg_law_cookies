  "Through the lens of law, tales of justice unfurl,  
  In the dance of deceit, where innocence whirls.  
  From the shadows of Singapore, to the finfluencer's lure,  
  In the web of corruption, integrity must endure.  
  In this world of chaos, where truth and lies twirl,  
  Stand firm, oh law, our protective pearl."

Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

"Through the lens of law, tales of justice unfurl,  
In the dance of deceit, where innocence whirls.  
From the shadows of Singapore, to the finfluencer's lure,  
In the web of corruption, integrity must endure.  
In this world of chaos, where truth and lies twirl,  
Stand firm, oh law, our protective pearl."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


This article discusses a case in Singapore where a married man was sentenced to 10 years in jail and caning for repeatedly sexually abusing a teenage girl he wanted to adopt. The man, a manager at a youth leadership development firm, preyed on the vulnerability of the 16-year-old girl and subjected her to multiple forms of sexual penetration. This case is the first prosecution under the new Section 376AA of the Penal Code, which aims to protect minors between 16 and 18 years old from exploitative sexual activity. The victim suffered from adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of previous abuse. The man is expected to surrender in January 2024 to begin serving his sentence. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/10-years-jail-caning-for-married-man-over-repeated-sexual-abuse-of-teen-girl-he-wanted-to-adopt)\]

This article discusses the need to regulate "finfluencers," individuals who provide financial advice and information on social media platforms. The rise of these influencers has made it easy for anyone to acquire financial knowledge, but they often lack accountability for the advice they give. The recent Jpex fraud in Hong Kong, where influencers promoted a crypto platform that led to financial losses for many, highlights the risks associated with unregulated finfluencers. Currently, there are no specific regulations governing content created by financial influencers in Singapore. The article argues that it is important to have regulations in place to supervise and monitor financial influencers to protect the public from potential harm and financial loss.

In conclusion, the article calls for the regulation of financial influencers in Singapore to prevent incidents like the Jpex fraud and ensure accurate and responsible financial advice is provided to the public. This may include extending the supervision of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to cover financial influencers, making existing guidelines legally binding, and implementing penalties for violations. The article also suggests the need for structured training and certification programs for influencers to ensure their competence and safeguard the public interest. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Time-to-regulate-influencers-who-tell-you-where-to-put-your-money-Opinion)\]

A former employee of Singapore Airlines (SIA) has been sentenced to 10 months in jail for corruption and using ill-gotten gains to buy Microsoft shares. Lionel Low Jun Jie, the assistant manager of properties at SIA, provided confidential information to an interior design firm to help it bid for tenders from the national carrier.
