  "In courts where justice and commerce twine,  
  Lies told in towers, truth in decline.  
  From Singapore's shores to Dubai's sands,  
  Guilt's shadow stretches, law's firm hand.  
  In the dance of deceit, the guilty plea,  
  In the world's grand stage, truth will be free."

"In courts where justice and commerce twine,  
Lies told in towers, truth in decline.  
From Singapore's shores to Dubai's sands,  
Guilt's shadow stretches, law's firm hand.  
In the dance of deceit, the guilty plea,  
In the world's grand stage, truth will be free."

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The Court of Appeal in Singapore has ruled that the owner of a Singapore company is not personally liable for the company's failure to deliver Covid-19 test kits to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The owner, Mr. Nicholas Eng Teng Cheng, had been sued by the Buenos Aires government for breach of contract. The appeal centered around whether Singapore law or Argentine law should apply to the "lifting of the corporate veil" and hold the owner personally responsible. The Court of Appeal concluded that Singapore law should apply because the company was incorporated in Singapore, and Singapore law does not provide a legal basis to disregard the separate legal personality of a company. The court also ordered the Buenos Aires government to pay Mr. Eng's legal costs. 

In conclusion, the Court of Appeal in Singapore has ruled that the owner of a Singapore company is not personally liable for the company's failure to deliver Covid-19 test kits to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Singapore law was deemed to apply, and there was no legal basis to lift the corporate veil. This ruling reinforces the principle of separate legal personality for companies and protects shareholders from personal liability for the company's breaches of contract. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Owner-of-Spore-firm-not-personally-liable-for-failure-to-deliver-Covid-19-kits-to-Argentina)\]
