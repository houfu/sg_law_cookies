In the courtroom's shadow, justice stands tall,<br>  
A gavel's echo, a family's call.<br>  
AI whispers in homes, reshaping the land,<br>  
While consumers seek trust, a guiding hand.<br>  
In the dance of change, old and new collide,<br>  
A world in flux, where laws and tech abide.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the execution of Iskandar Rahmat, a former police officer convicted of the double murder of Mr. Tan Boon Sin and his son during a robbery attempt. 

Key legal aspects include Iskandar's conviction for murder, which was upheld despite his claims of self-defense. The prosecution successfully argued that the premeditated nature of the crime, evidenced by the multiple stab wounds, warranted the death penalty. The case underscores the legal principles surrounding intent and premeditation in homicide cases. 

The execution provides a sense of closure for the victims' family, highlighting the emotional and psychological impacts of violent crime on victims and their communities. 

In conclusion, this case illustrates the complexities of criminal law, particularly in establishing intent and the implications of capital punishment in providing closure to victims' families. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Now-I-can-finally-let-it-go-Employee-relatives-of-Kovan-double-murder-victims-find-some-closure)\]

The article discusses the introduction of Maia, an AI chatbot by Mogul.sg, designed to assist home buyers in Singapore by streamlining property searches and reducing costs associated with traditional buyerâ€™s agents. 

Key legal aspects include the potential disruption of the real estate commission structure, as Maia charges only 0.2% compared to the typical 1% in co-broking arrangements. This shift may prompt regulatory scrutiny regarding fair competition and consumer protection. The implications for real estate agents are significant; they may need to adapt by enhancing their services to remain competitive. 

In conclusion, while AI can simplify the home-buying process, the irreplaceable value of human agents in negotiation and personalized service remains critical. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/New-AI-chatbot-in-Singapore-could-replace-buyers-agent-in-property-deals)\]

The article discusses significant consumer losses in Singapore due to prepayments for services that were not delivered, particularly in the home renovation sector, which saw the highest financial impact.

In 2024, consumers reported losses exceeding $1.93 million, primarily from sudden business closures and unresponsive contractors. Notably, 97% of complaints against renovation contractors were directed at those not accredited by CaseTrust, highlighting the importance of engaging accredited companies for consumer protection. The article emphasizes the need for updated consumer protection laws to address the rise in prepayment losses and e-commerce complaints, which surged by 25% in 2024.

In conclusion, the article underscores the necessity for enhanced consumer safeguards, particularly in sectors involving large prepayments, and advocates for legislative reforms to better protect consumers in the evolving digital marketplace. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Consumers-lost-almost-2m-in-prepayments-in-2024-highest-losses-from-home-renovations-Case)\]
