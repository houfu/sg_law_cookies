In courts where justice's scales are weighed,    
A jeweler's lapse, a gambler's raid,    
Estate claims eased, a family's aid,    
Divorce's dance, assets remade.    
Laws shape lives, in shadows cast,    
A world in flux, where futures fast.  

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses a significant legal case involving Kim Heng Jewellers and Goldsmiths, which was fined $35,000 under Singapore's Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act. 

The case marks the first prosecution under this new law, highlighting the importance of conducting proper customer due diligence to prevent money laundering. Employees sold over $313,000 worth of jewelry, with $140,000 traced back to victims of malware scams. Despite prior training on compliance, the employees failed to perform necessary checks, raising questions about the business owner's responsibility in ensuring adherence to legal standards.

The ruling emphasizes the legal obligation for businesses to implement effective anti-money laundering measures and the consequences of negligence in this area. 

In conclusion, this case serves as a cautionary tale for businesses in regulated sectors, reinforcing the need for robust compliance training and practices to mitigate risks associated with money laundering. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Store-fined-35k-after-its-workers-sold-jewellery-to-customers-who-paid-with-scam-proceeds)\]

The article discusses a significant change in the claims process for small estates in Singapore, specifically regarding assets held with the Central Depository (CDP) when a person dies intestate.

Relatives of deceased individuals with assets valued at S$5,000 or less can now claim these assets without needing legal documentation, effectively eliminating potentially high legal costs. This reform, effective November 19, aims to streamline the claims process and reduce processing times. However, applicants must still meet specific conditions, such as obtaining consent from all beneficiaries to prevent disputes.

In conclusion, this change alleviates the financial burden on families during difficult times while ensuring a structured approach to asset claims. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Legal-documents-no-longer-needed-for-small-claims-on-a-deceaseds-CDP-assets)\]

The article discusses a significant police operation targeting illegal horse betting activities in Singapore, following the closure of the Singapore Turf Club. 

Seventy-three individuals are under investigation for roles including illegal bookmakers and punters, with police seizing over $43,000 in cash and betting paraphernalia. The operation underscores Singapore's strict enforcement against illegal gambling, emphasizing that Singapore Pools is the sole legal operator. 

Legal implications include penalties under the Gambling Control Act: fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment for individuals gambling with illegal providers, while operators face fines up to $500,000 and seven years' imprisonment. 

In conclusion, this operation serves as a strong deterrent against illegal gambling activities in Singapore. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/73-investigated-for-suspected-involvement-in-illegal-horse-betting-activities)\]

This article discusses a recent appellate decision in a divorce case in Singapore, where a man successfully appealed for a larger share of matrimonial assets amounting to $13.2 million. 

The Appellate Division of the High Court increased the man's share from 55% to 65%, emphasizing his indirect contributions and recognizing that a significant portion of the assets stemmed from his pre-marriage wealth. The court noted the importance of mutual cooperation in marriage, cautioning against asset tracing that could encourage calculative behavior. The ruling highlights the need for clear documentation of financial contributions in divorce cases, while also reinforcing the principles of the Womenâ€™s Charter regarding family welfare.

In conclusion, this case underscores the complexities of asset division in divorce, particularly in light of pre-marital assets and indirect contributions, while advocating for cooperative financial practices within marriages. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Man-gets-13m-more-in-divorce-after-he-partly-wins-appeal-over-132m-in-assets)\]
