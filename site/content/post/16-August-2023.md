In Singapore's court, justice prevails,  
From tragic crimes to legal tales.  
A father's actions, dark and grim,  
A tycoon's appeal, dismissed on a whim.  
Stablecoins regulated, a new frontier,  
Legal news, summarized and clear.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


Singaporean man Xavier Yap has been sentenced to 14 years in jail for killing his 11-year-old twin sons, who had autism. Yap believed it would relieve his wife's burdens and protect the boys from future bullying. He strangled and submerged them in a canal. The judge considered Yap's mental state and the vulnerability of the boys in the sentencing. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Father-sentenced-to-14-years-jail-for-killing-autistic-twin-sons-11-in-Bukit-Timah)\]
