Here's a summary of today's post, in the form of a short poem:

In boardrooms where family ties fray,<br>  
Extradition's dance in legal ballet.<br>  
Scams weave webs, victims ensnared,<br>  
Laws evolve, justice declared.<br>  
Cross-border whispers, treaties bind,<br>  
In the legal maze, clarity we find.

## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses the complexities of corporate governance and the responsibilities of directors, highlighted by the ongoing dispute between Kwek Leng Beng and his son Sherman at City Developments Limited (CDL). 

Key legal aspects include the statutory duties of directors under the Companies Act, which encompass acting in good faith, disclosing interests, and exercising due diligence. Experts emphasize the importance of due diligence prior to board appointments, particularly in family-run businesses, to avoid potential legal liabilities. Red flags such as imbalanced board composition and restrictive clauses may indicate governance issues. 

In conclusion, the role of directors is increasingly demanding, requiring vigilance in navigating legal and corporate governance challenges. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/CDL-saga-highlights-complexities-of-corporate-governance-and-role-of-directors-say-experts)\]

The article discusses the extradition case of Paulus Tannos, an Indonesian businessman wanted for corruption, marking a significant legal development under a new treaty between Singapore and Indonesia.

Tannos, accused of involvement in a major corruption scandal linked to Indonesia's e-ID project, has been a fugitive since 2021. His arrest in Singapore raises questions about extradition processes, particularly regarding his claims of diplomatic immunity due to a passport from Guinea-Bissau, which Singaporean authorities dispute. The case highlights the complexities of cross-border legal cooperation and the potential for lengthy extradition proceedings, especially if contested.

In conclusion, Tannos' case underscores the challenges of international law in corruption cases and the importance of treaty frameworks in facilitating extradition. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/At-the-heart-of-a-cross-border-extradition-case-is-Indonesias-most-wanted-man-Who-is-Paulus-Tannos)\]

The article discusses the ongoing challenges faced by scam victims and their families in Singapore, emphasizing the need for comprehensive support systems.

The author advocates for expanding these restrictions to licensed moneylenders to prevent further financial harm. Additionally, the suggestion of training ethical scam baiters raises questions about legal boundaries and ethical considerations in combating scams.

In conclusion, the article highlights the necessity for a centralized resource for victims and families, alongside innovative strategies to enhance public awareness and support. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Help-scam-victims-and-families-figure-out-the-next-steps-Forum)\]
