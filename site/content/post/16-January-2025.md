## Here are some news articles from the Singapore Law Watch.


The article discusses Singapore's new Code of Practice for Online Safety for App Distribution Services, which mandates that app stores block users under 18 from accessing adult content. 

Key legal aspects include the requirement for app stores, such as Apple and Google, to implement "age assurance" measures by March 31, 2025, to prevent minors from downloading inappropriate apps. This includes using AI and facial recognition technology for age verification. Non-compliance could lead to being blocked under the Broadcasting Act. The code aims to enhance child safety online and aligns with global trends in regulating tech platforms.

In conclusion, this regulation underscores the growing accountability of tech companies in safeguarding minors from harmful content, reflecting a significant shift in digital governance. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/App-stores-must-block-under-18s-in-S-pore-from-accessing-adult-apps)\]

The article discusses the sentencing of a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officer for the tragic death of a firefighter during a blaze, highlighting critical legal and operational responsibilities within emergency services.

Warrant Officer 2 Muhammad Kamil Mohamed Yasin was sentenced to six months in jail after pleading guilty to causing grievous hurt through a rash act. He left a full-time national serviceman, Sergeant 1 Edward H. Go, to fight a fire alone, contravening SCDF protocols that mandate firefighters operate in pairs. The incident raises significant implications regarding duty of care and accountability in emergency response operations. The court emphasized that no justification exists for leaving a colleague in such perilous conditions.

In conclusion, this case underscores the legal ramifications of neglecting established safety protocols in emergency services, reinforcing the importance of adherence to operational guidelines to prevent tragic outcomes. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/SCDF-officer-gets-6-months-jail-over-death-of-NSF-firefighter-who-fought-Henderson-Road-blaze-alone)\]

The article discusses UK activist investor Palliser Capital's protest against OCBC's takeover of Great Eastern, raising concerns about shareholder fairness. 

Palliser has accused OCBC of offering a "gravely unfair" deal, particularly for minority shareholders, and criticized Great Eastern's board for complacency and insufficient corporate governance safeguards. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore Exchange (SGX) are monitoring the situation, indicating potential regulatory implications. Notably, OCBC's previous offer was deemed "not fair but reasonable" by an independent adviser, highlighting the ongoing scrutiny of corporate takeover practices.

In conclusion, Palliser's actions could influence corporate governance standards and shareholder rights in Singapore, emphasizing the importance of fair treatment in takeovers. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/UK-activist-investor-Palliser-takes-protest-against-Great-Eastern-takeover-to-MAS-SGX)\]

The article discusses the recent passage of Singapore's Workplace Fairness Act (WFA) and critiques its limitations in protecting vulnerable workers, particularly LGBTQ and disabled individuals. 

Key legal aspects include the WFA's five protected characteristics, which exclude sexual orientation, gender identity, and certain disabilities. Critics argue this omission undermines protections and could perpetuate discrimination, as seen in comparative jurisdictions like the U.S. under the ADA. The article highlights the Act's narrow focus on formal employment decisions, neglecting salary discrimination and broader workplace interactions. 

In conclusion, while the WFA marks progress, it necessitates further amendments to ensure comprehensive protection for all workers, particularly marginalized groups. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/The-Workplace-Fairness-Act-must-go-further-if-we-are-to-stamp-out-discrimination-Opinion)\]

The article discusses the legal empowerment of cabbies and platform workers in Singapore under the newly enacted Platform Workers Act, which allows three associations to represent them in negotiations for improved working conditions.

Key legal aspects include the recognition of platform workers as a distinct legal category, granting them rights similar to employees, such as financial compensation for work-related injuries. The National Taxi Association, National Private Hire Vehicles Association, and National Delivery Champions Association can now negotiate with platform operators, enhancing workers' bargaining power. The Act also mandates increased Central Provident Fund contributions for younger workers to bolster their financial security.

In conclusion, this development marks a significant shift in labor rights for platform workers, potentially leading to better compensation and working conditions. \[[link](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/Headlines/Cabbies-platform-workers-can-be-legally-represented-by-3-associations-NTUC)\]
