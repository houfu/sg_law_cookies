The woman, now 34, had a son and a daughter from a previous marriage.\n\nThe couple had four children of their own together, including Umaisyah.\n\nWhen she was about three to four months old in November 2011, she was placed in foster care as the man was detained in a drug rehabilitation centre, while his wife was assessed to be unable to take care of the girl.\n\nOn June 1, 2013, Umaisyah was returned to the couple’s care and custody, but she often cried and was not comfortable with her parents, who were not familiar to her.\n\nThe couple abused Umaisyah up till her eventual death. The man would hit her with a belt and hanger, slap her face and leg, cane her palm, punch her thigh, and pinch her thigh and body.\n\nThe man similarly abused another daughter as well as his stepson.\n\nBetween March 2013 and March 2014, the man ill-treated his stepson on numerous occasions by hitting him with a belt, a hanger and his bare hands, slapping his face and body, and punching his body and hand.\n\nOn the morning of March 2014, the couple were upset with Umaisyah as she was playing with her faeces after soiling her diaper.\n\nWhen the girl cried, the woman slapped her on the cheek. The man, who had taken methamphetamine that morning, slapped the girl on the face two to three times.\n\nThe girl, whose mouth was bloodied, collapsed and started gasping for air. Prosecutors said the trauma to Umaisyah’s head as a result of the accused’s assaults caused significant traumatic brain injury, which led to a concussive seizure.\n\nAfter Umaisyah’s lips turned blue, the woman tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate her. The couple did not call for help because they were worried that they would be arrested for the girl’s injuries.\n\nTo cover their tracks, they placed the girl’s body in a metal pot and set the body on fire at the back of the man’s lorry.\n\nAfter placing the pot in a box and sealing it, they took the box back to the flat. The woman cautioned her younger brother against touching the box under the stove.\n\nIn the days and years that followed, when asked by family members about Umaisyah’s whereabouts, the couple either lied that the girl had returned to her foster parents or that she was being cared for by the man’s aunt in Melaka.\n\nIn 2017, the woman’s younger brother tried to throw the box away as there were cockroach eggs in the cling wrap.\n\nThe woman told him to bring the box back before she rewrapped it with new cling wrap, and cautioned him against touching it again.\n\nIn December 2017, an officer from the Education Ministry contacted the couple to check why Umaisyah had yet to register for Primary 1. By then, the couple were estranged and the man had moved out.\n\nThe woman lied that Umaisyah had been taken away by the man, while the man lied that his parents had been taking care of her for the previous three years but he was unaware of her whereabouts.\n\nIn August 2019, while the woman was in prison, her younger brother decided to open the cardboard box, which was wet. He saw a black lump inside the pot that looked decomposed. He threw away the box and placed the pot in another container.\n\nHe told her about this when he visited her in prison, but she told him to place the pot back under the stove.\n\nOn Sept 9, 2019, he showed the contents of the pot to his sister’s friends.

All facial features were absent, and the hands and feet could not be identified.\n\nAny external injury could not be seen owing to the significant fire damage and advanced state of decomposition, and hence he could not ascertain the time or cause of death.\n\nOn Sept 17, 2019, the couple were charged with murder. By then, they were in remand for unrelated offences.\n\nThe woman was serving five years and two months in jail for drug-related charges and theft.\n\nThe man, who had jumped bail after he was charged in April 2018 with rioting, was arrested again on June 19, 2018. He was found to have consumed methamphetamine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Justice Abdullah noted that the man was arrested in 2018 and asked why his case was only now being heard.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Wong Woon Kwong replied that because Umaisyah’s body was destroyed, significant investigations had to be conducted to verify the cause of death and reconstruct the events.\n\nOn March 2, 2021, the woman was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for her murder charge. This means she can still be prosecuted for the offence later, depending on the evidence that emerges.\n\nShe faces 12 other charges, including ill-treating another four of her children.
